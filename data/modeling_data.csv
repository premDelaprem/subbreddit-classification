0,So a bit of backstory I did my lifeguarding qualification in November and then today had a lifeguard training session Now the person doing the training was an asshole to me all 2 hours because I couldn't remember near as enough as I should from the qualification even though I passed All session he was telling me what to do very angrily and making jokes out of me the whole session to make others laugh at me because I couldn't remember much which I couldn't handle because I have audio processing issues I have everyone laughing at me staring at me and also I need to see it visually done It really doesn't help that my medication doesn't come till tomorrow and I hadn't taken my medication therefore it was extremely hard BUT there's some good news out of today I have finally got shared care of my medication with my GP But also fuck that guy People don't get US At ALL,ADHD
1,So Adderall IRs were a total no-go for me Switched to XRs take em in the morning and honestly I feel great with them I'm super productive calm focused and I experience a lot more emotional introspection which has been awesome and necessary in my mental health recovery process HOWEVER the comedown is fucking rough I take it early in the morning take vitamin C at the 12 hour mark and then cannot sleep AT ALL I get super anxious physically uncomfortable and cannot even keep my eyes closed physically much less sleep The only way to combat this has been to take Xanax at night on the days that I take my Adderall but I hatehatehate Xanax It helps me to sleep and not be anxious but the day after is always super rough mentally I would like to avoid Xanax at all costs but I simply cannot take Adderall without it I have tried changing the dose taking it even earlier generic vs name brand melatonin vitamin C cough syrup etc Just not sure what to do at this point Would switching to Vyvanse possibly help Concerta did not work for me at all AAAAAAA TLDR Adderall works super well for me during the day but makes me anxious and unable to sleep when wearing off Advice Adderall Making Me Super Anxious AAAAA,ADHD
2,Regular Ritalin IR works well but I don t like the crash feeling at all I tried Ritalin LA but it s like 2 bursts of Ritalin for me Is there anything that constantly releases slow low dose of Ritalin with no real peak Basically I want to feel how Ritalin instant release makes me feel without the peaks and crashes Anything that releases methylphenidate constantly vs 2 bursts like Ritalin la,ADHD
3,I started vyvanse a few months ago 10 mg dose the first day I ever tried it was potentially the most euphoric experience of my life Not like extreme out of this world euphoria I d expect from other drugs but rather I was just so at peace it was incredibly pleasant to have my mind quiet down But then after a few days I felt nothing at all when I took it so I told my doctor and he upped the dose 20 mg first day felt something second day felt something slowly but surely felt nothing As in no effects positive or negative from taking the pill 30 mg I cannot even bring myself to take this pill regularly because of the side effects I within an hour of it kicking in I get this horrible misery dawning over me I get incredibly anxious miserable irritable I can t eat for the whole day I get headaches I decided not to not take the pill for a month and wait till my mental health got better and tried it again recently and well here s what happened profusely cold-sweating chest pain dizziness and my left arm went incredibly weak I googled this and apparently I was nearing a heart attack Safe to say I m never taking this fkn stimulant again I want some advice from others on what steps to take forth After that near heart-attack I m too scared to try any other stimulants What alternative paths have worked for others in improving managing ADHD Vyvanse side effects any other paths,ADHD
4,Evening has anyone who has a documented diagnosis of ADHD over 10 years previous and prescribed vyvanse or similar been required to submit to quarterly drug testing Mind you this is via a general practitioner and the patient has no history of abuse Simply moved to a new area with new GP while others with same conditions in same geo area do not What s this about Question GP testing,ADHD
5,After having a really bad time starting my medication journey with Medikinet MPH I just did my first full day on 30mg Elvanse Vynasse A night and day difference in a positive way Almost no side effects during the day Just the medication helping me more than I could imagine The crash low energy and headache starting around 6pm was unpleasant but not debilitating like Medikinet Hopefully it stays this way I am super optimistic though Thanks for listening Hopefully found my med,ADHD

9,TLDR My ADHD makes it hard to remember things and to form habits Does anyone know any tricks to get rid of brain fog what habits I should be building and how to build those habits As a woman with ADHD I was never really taught how to handle everything I'm 20 years old having a hard time knowing what habits I need and how to form them On top of that I find I have an intense brain fog that makes me forget a lot of things after they happen Conversations stuff I learned in school things I've been asked to do things I've already told people The only way to remember things is to write them down but that doesn't help with college Since rereading notes I just took yesterday doesn't help it stick I even tend to forget what I just wrote as I'm taking notes I also can't write down habits I want to get into on my calendar or as an alarm More for fear of being judged by my parents or friends finding that I have alarms set to brush my teeth and wash up I also can't have things out and in my face since I live with my parents So I just want to know any tricks or books I can read to help Tips and tricks for building habits,ADHD
10,I used to be an avid Tiktok user Scrolling for hours and I'm sure some of you can understand It was so bad that I would watch over 500 videos a day and not remember a single thing that I watched It's also burnt into my iphone screen so that's something I deleted it a couple days ago and find myself having finger memory and swiping to where it used to be Have any of you used tiktok that much or also quit because of how much you watched it I would lose track of time find myself watching videos that weren't good for my mental health and also comparing myself to other people which would put me down RIP to my drafts but I never watched them anyway Quitting Tiktok,ADHD
11,I was prescribed Vyvanse 20mg and switched to Adderall 5mg I know these are low dosages and I have doubled them on a couple days to test out slightly higher I switched because with Vyvanse I really felt like I was on something especially when I drank coffee and it really didn't feel quite right regardless With or without coffee I feel much better on Adderall The funny thing is that I'm reading all the differences between them and people say that the Adderall levo is what kicks you in the butt but I found that way more on Vyvanse Executive dysfunction is my main problem and the Vyvanse really helped with that I'm wondering if anyone has had similar experiences and if they found Dexedrine to be the final solution Seems strange that everyone says Adderall is what got them moving over Vyvanse dex Also even with the low dose of Adderall xr I'm having a harder time sleeping than Vyvanse I know this topic has come up but I'm hoping someone out there has had opposite effects to the norm and can provide some insight I'm in Canada and specialists are impossible to find Another oddity is I find Adderall XR to be way smoother than Vyvanse Adderall and Vyvanse are opposite for me from what I'm reading,ADHD
12,Hey all I'm a year out of a very long relationship and I'm finding it very difficult to find someone that my mind is happy with I'm not looking as such but I obviously think about it It's hard to explain but I'm sure people here will understand there's a million layers I can talk to anyone but it's extremely rare I'll talk to someone that fits There are thousands of pretty girls but it's like I can't see that It's almost like I can see through people Very rarely will I see someone that hits me on all levels like I can see their personality in their eyes and I can feel that they're kind That's when trouble starts for me I am a complete fool honestly I live for romance and love but the ADHD just runs amok and I'll plan a whole life with someone without even knowing them The thing is I'm really like that I will fully commit my entire life to someone I did before I just want to be normal but at the same time I think that part of me would be amazing for the right person How does everyone else manage this Do they medicate or otherwise control their spinning thoughts or do they hold out for someone that matches I would and have previously moved country to be with someone Is that insane or romantic I don't know Dating After Long Relationship,ADHD
13,All I do every day as soon as I get home is play video games Eat junk food order takeaways watch YouTube all simultaneously in an effort to get dopamine hits which I seriously am struggling to actually get to that point because I regret all my purchases on games I regret eating loads I am a slim guy and I used to go to the gym and had a really good grasp on my life I was accountable and I was really making good progress with life but ever since my mother died I've just had a really big downfall and my ADHD is even harder to control in my life ever Really don't know how to deal with myself at the moment and can see myself slipping away I need help,ADHD
14,I was diagnosed with ADHD and have been on adderall since about 3rd grade I have taken 30mg XR for about 17 years and rarely go a day without I talked to my doctor recently and he said that if I planned to get pregnant he would stop my adderall as soon as I m pregnant I am a registered nurse and the unit I work on is very busy I am worried about being able to be a nurse and not take my adderall I discussed this with him and he said adderall has a black label and he would no longer prescribe me the medication Obviously my future baby is my number 1 priority I am just also worried about if I would be able to work and the safety of my patients Has anyone else been on adderall this long and had to stop abruptly Any words of advice would be great Thank you Having to discontinue adderall once I m pregnant after being on it for 17 years,ADHD

16,Is this an ADHD thing It's hard for me to start a task but even when I finally start and get into a groove I think this is probably not what I should be putting my energy into I feel like I'm not focusing on the right thing no matter what task you're doing Another comparable thought is Yeah I'm working on this project but I'm probably not doing it the right way the most interesting or useful way There's rarely a feeling of satisfaction achievement or this is exactly what I should be doing and it feels great I usually end up bouncing from task to task like a Sim searching for the one that feels right and that never happens so I finish the tasks projects that feel like I can finish them but I never feel accomplished Is this a common thing I'm also not medicated but I am diagnosed but if you are did medication help this feeling Feeling like you're never doing the right task,ADHD

20,Hi hello hi So I used to take Ritalin daily from 2020 to 2022 my psych cancelled my appointment randomly once and I kept forgetting to reschedule it for a whole year so here I am again restarting hopefully this month but I d like to know what to ask her for a prescription based on what s affordable available or as close as possibly to these We have had to change it before because I couldn t afford whatever I was on prior The climate seems wild rn When I was taking it the amount for one 30 day supply would bounce around from being 30 dollars to almost 100 with insurance United health and I could barely get it filled as most places were out NOW IT SEEMS WORSE And I ve been reading they released genetic versions What does this mean in terms of getting a new prescription Is there anything I should ask for Would love any guidance as I feel quite overwhelmed trying to sort through all the info currently Thanks you so much Help Going back on meds price shortage questions,ADHD
21,I have been actively trying to manage my RSD better and researching about it My RSD affects my relationship with my bf He is a therapist so he s very emotionally intelligent and observant of my triggers and feelings But he also communicates to me that he can t always be there to make me feel better or take me out of it Which is totally true and I am trying to be a better partner in that respect I watched this video today about RSD and the woman explaining it whom I adore btw said we are the only one responsible for our RSD which I obviously agree with Then she cut to her acting out a scenario where she s just spilling out all her emotions and frustrations This was supposed to be an example of what NOT to do I m a little confused though because I feel like I can t tell where the line is between venting and putting out your frustrations to the point it s now becoming someone else s problem I asked my bf and he said he also wasn t sure but he would ponder it So if any one could give some advice I d greatly appreciate it I feel like it could help me get some perspective How do I know when I m just venting or putting my issues onto someone else,ADHD

23,Most of the time when I'm trying to focus on work tasks or trying to study for an upcoming exam or something I find that staring at a screen and trying to read or work on something feels like holding my hand on a hot stove Like as soon as I start I'm just dying to pull away and divert my focus to something else I'll have 12 tabs open and cycle through them because as soon as I start working on something it's almost like actual pain to keep focus on it Is this normal I have my first evaluation later today to determine if I really have ADHD but I recently learned that as a kid I was diagnosed but my parents said well he has no problem focusing on video games so it can't possibly be ADHD even though looking back I showed so many symptoms it blows my mind I remember being made to sit at the table and do my homework and I'd just sit there and cry for hours because it felt like torture Sorry for the rant just anxious about my evaluation and looking to see what other people's experiences are Like holding my hand on a hot stove,ADHD
24,Vyvanse has been so helpful for me over the past couple of years One cool thing I ve noticed is it helps me complete tasks THOROUGHLY So before Dx Rx I would complete tasks at bare minimum but now I actually remove every individual thing from a surface before wiping it down or I completely put away all of the cleaning supplies once I m done rather than leaving bottles on the counter etc all of these little things that I couldn t be bothered with before that actually make a difference I just wanted to share something small that it s helped with because I feel like we usually talk about all of the big ways meds help The way medication helps with thorough task completion,ADHD
25,I was trying to get myself diagnosed I asked a clinic if they have providers that have experience diagnosing ADHD and who takes my insurance and they replied with this Good morning I apologize for the late response When you say ADHD diagnosis are you looking for a full ADHD standardized test that can be submitted to disability school etc Or are you just looking for a diagnosis which is essentially an educated opinion from a licensed professional This cannot be submitted to any disability paperwork but often helps the client with their own personal understanding Background about me I 31F am suspecting I have ADHD for a while since I can relate to a lot of the symptoms not being able to finish projects when they become uninteresting can t concentrate without doing something else forgetfulness lack of motivation random bouts of anxiety and depression and a lot more I am a transplant from another country and am now living in the US I don t have a PCP and this is my first time to seek help in the US healthcare system I was previously diagnosed with depression in my home country 4 yrs ago but I was managing without medication treatment for a while Lately I ve been struggling with work and I m now seeking help I was fired from my last job because I was working from home a lot and the higher-ups perceive I wasn t working non-verbatim but that s what they told me I don t want to mess up my new job My lovely superior knows about my mental health issues and she has made accommodations for me but the rest of my team don t So back to my question Do I need a full assessment I don t think my job will require it but it s good to have if ever my job suddenly requires proof or if I ever need to be medicated On the other hand I don t know if my insurance covers full ADHD assessment Especially since no one referred me one Also I am not even sure if this is ADHD but I want to get diagnosed accurately What are your experiences with diagnosis Do I need a full standardized test for ADHD,ADHD

46,Hi everyone In this post I want to get your guys feedback on Medikinet maybe other medication and impact on your daily lives I will first give some personal context but you can just skip to the bottom of the post if you just want the question s TLDR personal context and medication context given asking for experiences advice on different medications for ADHD My apologies if it seems kind of all over the place and for possible grammatical vocabulary errors English is not my first language Personal context I was diagnosed in june last year with ADHD As many of you I always thought I just was bad at concentrating starting to do this finishing tasks When I started working office job I noticed that I had a really hard time to adjust to working hours no more procrastinating working late at night I went to a neurologist for something unrelated and my symptoms came up She advised me to get tested for ADHD After a thorough psychodiagnostic analysis by psychologists psychiatrists several tests etc etc I was diagnosed with ADHD mostly extremely impacting my executive functions I guess this is the same for most of the people in this subreddit The reason it was only diagnosed when I was 24 is because due to my cognitive functions i was able to accomodate and or mask the symptoms of ADHD i e I was smart enough to finish a masters degree etc even wen experiencing extreme symptoms negative effects of ADHD Medication context The neurologist I think in Belgium it's always someone with a more medical background who has to prescribe meds first started me on Equasym XR After a couple of weeks months I noticed that this did almost nothing for me even at the max allowed dosage After a review with the neurologist I switched to Medikinet 30mg I started on 1 5 tablets day Then upped to 2 x 1 5 tablets day 2 x2 tablet day and finally current dosage 3 x 2 tablets day 3 hours inbetween Actual question I again have the feeling that the medication almost doesn't do anyting for me The weird thing is that when I take the first dose of the day at 08 45 I notice a huge boost in concentration and efficiency at work But when I take my second dosage after lunch around 12 30 and last dosage around 16 00 I barely notice any difference and get distracted very quickly I'm not able to get a grip of certain task and just start Is this something other people have noticed as well My neurologist said that she expects that I would be helped most with lis dexamfetamines Any review of for example Elvanse Is my expectation of just being able to work normally on medication too high Is the effect of medication just not that high Or should the difference between medicated and not-medicated by significant Maybe other tips for recently diagnosed ADHD-people Thanks in advance everyone for reading through the text maybe answerring one some of the questions P S This subreddit really helps me trying to accept my ADHD so thanks to everyone for contributing Experiences with Medikinet and advice on dose,ADHD
47,I really want to be better about it and I always beat myself up about not keeping in touch the way I want to I'll rarely send postcards or letters but that feels like a coward's way out instead of calling facetiming The other problem is just not remembering that the person is even there to call I wish that I had more friends more close friends but I need to be a good friend too Strategies for keeping in touch with family and friends that you love,ADHD

63,Since several manufacturers snuck out generics late last year I thought I'd do a quick post on some of them and how they may suddenly surprise you at the pharmacy I listed the two I know about and will update post if anyone shares additional ones Oct Mydayis Teva released this one late last year If you are unfamiliar it's an adderall-type base with a triple time release over 16-18 hours It was also rare and expensive enough to be largely unaffected by the shortages at least in my area Sept Vyvanse Also late-ish last year with several manufacturers now shipping If you would prefer either of these options and couldn't afford it before that may be different now depending on your insurance plans etc If you were already ON one of them the next pharmacy trip may be a surprise If your plan mandates generic if available you may have a choice between coughing up several hundred for your written prescription or waiting until your doc can call in a new generic-Rx The pharmacist themselves MAY also be able to substitute but that gets into a minefield of what's actually allowed what people think is allowed state laws Dr vs pharmacist discretion etc so I'm not getting into it 1 Go talk to your pharmacy now BEFORE your refill is due and ask their procedure 2 If they can't switch then go call your Doc to make the update All 2023 first-time generic releases https www drugs com generic-approvals-archive 2023 html New Generic Drugs aka why is my Rx suddenly expensive,ADHD

94,What's your mentality about work How do you approach it Were you always engaged with it or did you develop it over time I've been trying to approach work as less of a chore and more an activity that Im opting into I think I've always somewhat coasted at my jobs because I saw it as a necessary evil Im trying to change that I recently read a biography of this sculptor Ruth Asawa and I was inspired by her approach to all kinds of work farm labor sculpting etc The sense I get was that she was always super engaged with her work and saw working hard as a core virtue something that fulfilled her Would love to get people's insight as to what inspires them to work hard everyday especially with adhd Question for those who are engaged hard working at their job,ADHD
95,i'm currently in a massive debate with myself as to whether i should try pursuing a diagnosis bc but i think the biggest point of distress for me is the fact i can't communicate anything important whatever conclusion i reached was done with like 4 dimensions of every reason that id ever need but as soon as i land on the conclusion the words of my justifications disappear can't speak it can't explain myself to others but the image of the network in my head justifies it is this an adhd thing or am i just fucking stupid lmfao forgetting all the reasons,ADHD
96,Whenever I get upset about ANYTHING i always get asked the same damnable question and it's really starting to tick me off They never ask Why are you upset Is something bothering you what happened to upset you Is there some way I can help did someone say something to you or anything like that NO it's always Did you remember to take your tablets this morning Did you take your pills When last did you take your meds or some other variation of that question as if drinking Ritalin will suddenly make whatever is upsetting me not upset me YES I DID TAKE MY DARN TABLETS AND I'M STILL UPSET STOP INVALIDATING MY FEELINGS AND EXPERIENCES Just because I have ADHD doesn't mean I can't be justifiably upset about anything and taking more pills isn't going to make my feelings magically go away Vent Why is it always the same question,ADHD
97,Good evening to the ADHD Reddit community I want to ask some questions or rather exchange information about ADHD as we face it in everyday life The truth is that while I have people who somehow understand the situation I believe that it is not the same as talking to someone who has it Anyway how is your experience with ADHD Tomorrow I start with a psychiatrist in Athens who specializes in ADHD cases and I'm a little stressed and I don't know even though I've read a few things about what exactly medication does to you and if there's a better way than medication Also at least on the English Reddit for ADHD I read a lot of situations that happen to me as the number ONE inability to manage time Do you have any life hacks to deal with this I've also been doing psychotherapy for almost 3 years and while it has helped me I feel that it's starting to become a loop that doesn't take me anywhere else Sorry for the long post it just took me several years after my diagnosis 14 years old to deal seriously with ADHD and the truth is that it has taken a toll on me psychologically Thank you for your time I google translate since my main language is Greek and i wanted to give you as much information as I could Sorry i reposted it from the greek subreddit which i used earlier amp x200B Hello ADHD Redditors some questions,ADHD

104,Okay here's my story in full I moved to a new country about two years ago Back in high school I used Ritalin which was the main reason I managed to graduate After relocating I consulted a doctor at Kaiser who suggested I might not have ADHD but possibly Bipolar Disorder and therefore didn't prescribe any stimulants Now that I'm in college I took 3 classes with grades D C and B which are quite terrible I have to retake the D so basically failed one class I switched doctors but I'm not comfortable with the new one he seems judgmental I've heard that I can only change my mental health doctor three times so I feel like I'm screwed I'm aware of Kaiser don't have a good reputation when it comes to mental health care But I don't have the luxury of switching insurances right now and paying 600 per session out of pocket is too much for me Are there any reliable budget-friendly online services I've come across mixed reviews about Done and others Also I'm currently living in the Bay Area if that makes any Any Affordable Online ADHD Treatment options,ADHD

106,Is it safe to skip adderall xr when you are sick Hi I 25f re-started adderall on 12 14 after about a year being off of it with a low dose of 10mg xr Hoping to increase later on I took it every day On 12 31 when I came down with a stomach bug but I still took adderall for two days because I was afraid of withdrawal However today I skipped it to see if that would allow me to rest I have read that some people don t take it on the weekend to decrease dependency However I wasn t sure if that was safe to do if I was only just starting back on it So anyways it made it hard to sleep while sick so I stopped taking it today but I am wondering how many days it is safe to not take it for Can I skip it tomorrow if I m still feeling sick Ironically last night I couldn t sleep and I wonder if it is because I skipped adderall I noticed that I am more tired at the end of the day if I take adderall in the morning and I know that adhd people can have a messed up circadian rhythm My friend also told me that they only take it on work days So I guess my question is How long is it ok to skip adderall if you are new to the drug but are under the weather Following up with that if you are new to the drug when is it ok to skip days to prevent dependency ie should I not skip the drug till I ve been on adderall a month or two etc and how many days is ok to skip to prevent withdrawal Should it not be more than 2-3 I m worried That once I m feeling better I will have to start all over again with side effects and it won t be fun I should clarify that I am diabetic and immunocompromised so I tend to stay sicker longer than most people unfortunately I m usually good at writing but I am under the weather so I apologize if this is very confusing to read How many days in a row is it safe to skip a stimulant,ADHD
107,Obviously we're already online discussing ADHD in this subreddit Still I wanted to hear your takes Do you think that it helps you understand yourself better or is it more harmful than it is good Personally I find that browsing online helps me articulate feelings I've long experienced but suppressed I try to remain aware of not inadvertently convincing myself that I have new symptoms just because I've read about them Edit for a bit of context I recently got diagnosed with comorbid ADD OCD and Social Anxiety I tend to struggle with understanding how I work feel and even think Other peoples experiences as well as info about my disorders at medical sites have really helped Googling your diagnosis,ADHD

109,So to start I m in college Once I got diagnosed with ADHD at 20 I have had success at managing school life by really looking into help stuff and scheduling It really helped me having a launching off point that was the diagnosis But I am on medicine for ADHD but it doesn t help at my dose which is a high amount But because I m also diagnosed with bipolar II I ve been very scared of trying any other medicines because the next step would be stimulants But I m scared that if I try stimulants then my whole medication would need to be reworked which scares me And while I do know that I could work harder to overcome the symptoms without medicine I m in a high stress college situation because I dropped out for a few years so if I don t graduate on time then I d be off my parents insurance So to be completely honest I d rather take medicine so I can get through the last few years of college and focus on the other aspects of my mental health I guess I m wondering if anyone with bipolar II has had to go on stimulants and how that went Worrying about Medicine,ADHD
110,Curious if anyone has done the water titration with vyvanse but done it so they were getting less of a dose For example the pill is 50mg but you put less of the powder in water so that it equaled 25-30mg Anyone done this Does it even make sense to do it this way Only reason I want to do this is because i was prescribed 30mg took it for a while and it didnt work so I was upped to 50mg That didn't seem to do much either so i just stopped taking it altogether A few months later I wanted to give it a try again but my body hadn't been at the lower dose for so long that it was too much to start at the higher dose out of the blue Of course the only pills I have remaining are the 50mg and I moved and haven't been able to find a new doctor to prescribe me at the lower dose Vyvanse water titration,ADHD
111,Today I took 108 mg concerta 2x 54 mg and I had a panic attack I was using the same dosage for nearly 8 months and I take the medicine when I need it basically 2-3 weeks of use and 4-5 weeks of absence but my absence time got reduced to 2-3 weeks recently I was hungry before and after concerta usage and couldn t eat because of loss of appetite During the panic attack a friend who deals with similar panic attacks recommended a painkiller I dont want to disclose the name of the medication because Its a medication that can be abused but I can say that its the kind which makes you dizzy physically relaxed and lowers heartbeat After I took the painkiller I was relaxed but I still had extreme anxiety at the same time Both medications exited my body nearly at the same time at 3 AM but the anxiety became much worse again and I had another panic attack I felt like I was going to have a heart attack and after the panic attack I couldn t even close my eyes because I felt like I could die in my sleep I got myself checked in a clinic for every kind of bad thing that could kill me I thought of Nothing came up Now the anxiety has worn off and its 7 45 AM I can t sleep and my appetite didn t come back Now that my situation is known i need advice and or info about 1 About sleeping after concerta crash 2 Is my anxiety related to the dosage I m taking 3 What should I do when a similar situation occurs again 4 Is it possible that the methylphenidate did not exit my body properly I apologize if my post is hard to understand its because my mind is a mess right now Note I can barely think right now and it was hard for me to understand the rules completely If this post breaks any rules I apologize for that too Update I also had a surgery a week ago on my left arm I don t use any medication related to the surgery URGENT Need advice about sleeping and anxiety during and after concerta crash,ADHD
112,I was diagnosed with ADHD probably 20 years ago as an adult in his thirties I went to see someone to get re-diagnosed so I'd have paperwork because the previous clinic tosses the records after seven years After four sessions of testing and also for autism I was told that I have tendencies but didn't have ADHD but that it was tricky One thing the psychologist noted was that in the concentration computer test I was in the 60 percentile I was really in the zone and hyperfocused when I took it The thing is my whole family and three kids have been diagnosed My son is high functioning autistic I take online tests the ones from doctors and score highly My wife is pretty angry because she has been living with me for years and seen all of the symptoms I don't really think I've grown out of it My symptoms include terrible memory losing track of time chronic procrastination constantly interrupting conversations really really bored when someone else is talking physical agitation although that has decreased anxiety bad sleep sometimes it is ok high impulsivity which showed up on the test So I am not sure if he's telling me that I don't have it to the point where it is a full on disability but something is definitely going on As far as autism goes I show a lot of cognitive tendencies but don't qualify as full on autistic I'm wondering if I have just learned to compensate or maybe I'm just a chronically disorganized person with terrible social skills and poor facial recognition who always overshares and then worries about it later It is disheartening amp x200B Kicked out of the club,ADHD

120,I know there are hundreds of posts about the quality of adderall generics recently and for me I never really thought too much about it For the past year I have been taking these epic pink ir pills I stopped taking them in the beginning of December because I could just not stand the discomfort I was in every night I had terrible headaches and tension in my jaw and face For some reason I felt very irritable and anxious every single time I took it even if I took half of my dose Since stopping today I found one of my old pills and I just thought what the heck let me try it WTF I don t know if it s placebo I just am really trying to understand why it is making me feel so much better than the pink pill I found an Orange football one which I think is Teva Nonetheless am I Crazy for thinking this or is there some truth to it It might just be in my head or since I have started fixing my Tmj issues but damn tomorrow I m going to call my pharmacy and see if I can get this brand again Thinking of trying another medication maybe if I can t get this one but I might just stop forever I had a white pill in the past before that I liked too I just hope I don t sound nutty Was going to give up on medication until I found an old pill,ADHD
121,I ve always experienced feelings of euphoria when taking Ritalin 10mg It gives me confidence and motivation to be more social and I look forward to things and feel interested It often makes me wonder worry that I am just getting high from the medication and makes me question whether I truly have ADHD It does also make me feel calm and clear and stops my fidgetiness but the euphoria I feel from it overrides the calming effect Is this everyone else s experience Is my dose too high or is this just what feeling normal is I don t feel manic just excitable and happy I actually want to talk to people and talk more than I normally would I am typing this as I m feeling it and when I m not affected by the Ritalin I will look back and read this and think I would never have posted that without my meds because my brain is always twisted a jumble when I m unmediated and I can t string sentences together or I feel overwhelmed with having to express myself I hope that makes sense tl dr I worry my medication is just making me high when I feel confident and excited euphoric It s like a sense of adrenaline is this normal for everyone Ritalin causes euphoric feeling,ADHD
122,I've fallen into this pattern with my partner Throughout the week my partner shares what's stressing her out While I try to be present during these conversations more often than not I find myself zoning out especially if it's on the phone There are moments when I realize halfway through a story that I've drifted back to my computer and am checking Slack messages Oops But even in situations where I was 100 attentive I wake up the next morning and it's as if the slate has been wiped clean I'll notice that she's in a bad mood because of what she talked about throughout the week or even the previous day and my first response is to ask What's wrong She's understandably frustrated by this since she just told me or has been telling me all week But I just seem to forget that oh yeah those things that happened yesterday are probably relevant today too The frustrating part is that if I were to stop for a second and ask myself what is stressing her out before I actually asked the question I could probably come up with some decent answers Maybe not 100 but I could think she talked about X and Y recently maybe I can ask about those specific things At this point I'm thinking of keeping a note on my phone of stuff she's talked about recently but I fear that'd it'd become write only I have a hard enough time with habits as it is so keeping it updated regularly and remembering to look at it would be a challenge Any other ideas for how can I improve my focus and be the caring and supportive partner that I want to be Also I'm asking about the specific context of my relationship but I'm guessing similar strategies to combat this issue could be useful for friendships and work as well What strategies can I employ so that I stop to think about what is wrong before I ask my partner,ADHD

124,I'll be grateful if only people suffering from ADHD response to that post as their point of view is what I care about So my partner has ADHD we had a fight last week and not talking since then I made all of the possible mistakes I could while writing that stupid message to him I accused him of lack of time and interest and said how bad it makes me feel and that he's lying to me It wasn't the first time I did that I'm trying my best not to do that but sometimes my frustration takes control He said that I'm cruel and at this point it's something normal and I don't understand him I truly care about him and his well being about his emotions so I studied half of the internet just to educate myself about it but even though I still made mistakes I'm compulsive and often wrote things I regret later But I'm not regretting them because of the consequences of my actions like feeling sad but because I know it makes him feel really bad about himself and I can't forgive myself I hurted him that way because he doesn't deserve it He was right even if I thought I understand it turns out I don't It was never my intention to hurt him I was just trying to explain my feelings plus bit of frustration and sarcasm it turns out really bad A perfect recipe for disaster I'm trying to do my best and keep in mind he has an extraordinary brain that I fell in love with and I really don't want to lose it My question is how to properly apologize to him so he won't think it's just another meaningless sorry How to apologize to partner with ADHD,ADHD
125,I end up on these apps almost reflexively and then get stuck in an unpleasant hyperfocus I end up wasting so much time scrolling these two apps and end up losing sleep as well since I want to use them a bit but clearly can t limit my time spent here on my own is there a program or setting on my phone ipad that would block me from accessing them after a certain time Is there a way to make them inaccessible after I spend a certain amount of time on them I assume there would be a way to bypass anything I set myself but I don t believe I would override it Is their a way to block Reddit and Facebook on my ipad between certain hours and or force a limit on the time I can spend on them each day,ADHD
126,Tl Dr not seeking medical advice but rather experiences from people who have taken two smaller doses of medication VS one big dose I was on Vyvanse 20mg for a while and after a few weeks I felt it was wearing off too quickly My doctor increased my dosage to 30mg and I started to noticed uncomfortable side effects I mentioned this to my doctor who switched me to 10mg Adderall instead Unfortunately on the second day of Adderall I had a bit of a mental health crisis and went to the ER to speak with a psychiatrist They said I had a sensitivity to stimulants told me to stop taking them and prescribed me Strattera instead I am now currently taking 25mg of Strattera My concern is that I was pulled from stimulants without trying any other dosing method beyond take once a day in the morning I've heard some people take two smaller doses instead of one big one and I'm curious if this is worth mentioning to my doctor or not Currently my family doctor is prescribing my medication because my psychiatrist won't work with ADHD so I am not being monitored for the interactions with my bipolar medication If you have made the transition from once a day to twice a day was it worthwhile Do you take half a dose when you wake up and again early afternoon Any info I can bring to my doctor is appreciated Medication dosing once VS twice a day,ADHD

130,Unpopular opinion rant yes it is on us to try to find ways to help manage our disability and mitigate its impacts AND the fact remains that IT IS STILL A DISABILITY I am constantly seeing posts about how to hack our brains and how to basically function as if we don t have ADHD but the fact is that we DO have it and more often than not we re killing ourselves trying to figure out ways to function as if we don t If this were easily solvable it wouldn t be a diagnosis So yes be responsible Try your best AND also try to learn to accept the fact that our brains just work differently You wouldn t feel bad as a diabetic just because your pancreas doesn t work like everyone else s or as a paraplegic that you can t climb a flight of stairs like everyone else with working legs so why in the name of all that is good and holy should we be feeling bad bc our brains don t work like everyone else s It s ridiculous At some point society needs to meet us halfway and make room for us too Whatever the ADHD equivalent of diet cokes and the wheelchair ramps is society can make space for us and our brains too We already struggle enough as it is and I m so sick of us having to apologize for something we don t have control over that already makes our lives hard enough as it is without all the unnecessary moral judgments Edit to add I do have physical disabilities as well I m very well acquainted with the difficulties that come with that In my experience it has been completely different than the difficulties I ve faced as a result of my adhd One does not negate the other and no one s playing the struggle Olympics here so please stop with the comments about physical disabilities I ve lived that too and I m talking about my own life experience Thanks Square peg Round hole,ADHD

132,I was diagnosed with ADHD just over a year ago at the age of 37 and since then I've been trying to understand how it went unnoticed during my childhood adolescence and much of adulthood despite seeing psychologists throughout these stages of my life As a child I stood out for learning to read and write early and for communicating in a complex way for my age I enjoyed reading and was interested in things other kids didn't care about I did well in school effortlessly without a study routine at home because I didn't really need one I received school complaints for being distracted in class not copying content but somehow had good grades and a lot of ease in learning Everything changed during adolescence I couldn't keep up with classes impacting my school and family life The expectations increased and I was labeled as lazy and careless Unfortunately this extended into adulthood affecting studies work and relationships Despite the medical diagnosis as a child prodigy I still sometimes doubt whether I have a disorder How can I have ADHD if I didn't have issues in childhood That's when I read about twice-exceptionality I discovered that ADHD might have been masked by my high abilities Even my psychological analysis suggests a very high intelligence quotient With adolescence a lot changed and the disorder became more noticeable Can any of you relate to my story Do you have doubts about your diagnosis for the same reason Have you heard about twice-exceptionality in this context Sorry for any misspellings or other mistakes English is not my first language Twice-exceptionality,ADHD

141,Can you get medication withdrawal symptoms from taking medication inconsistently Specifically I'm taking ritalin 30mg but this week I've been really inconsistent with it having one day off on Saturday followed by only 20mg Monday 10mg on Wednesday and Thursday as well as reduced caffeine intake The reason I did this was because I was having spikes in anxiety and heartrate in the Wednesday and freaked myself out a bit so I took less medication and caffeine The resulting days were continued heat rate fluctuations light headedness anxiety and the worst sleep I've ever had where I was constantly jolted back awake with anxiety and a high heartrate every time I drifted off It was only after this that I noticed every issue I was having was listed as a ritalin withdrawal symptom could this be the cause even though I was still taking it just less Medication withdrawal from being taken inconsistently,ADHD
142,Hello all So I am a 31 year old woman diagnosed with ADHD at 30 Being on meds is life changing 6 years before I was diagnosed my kiddo was diagnosed Pretty sure all 3 of my kiddos have it but the others are only 6 and 3 6 year old has an appt soon to assess this But that's unrelated to this post Obviously all us ADHDers struggle with daily life needs From anything as small as picking up a piece of trash on the floor to cleaning rooms paying bills getting up to eat or pee etc I get it Oh my goshhh I get it I struggle so hard with all of that However I use reminder apps religiously to make sure I stay on top of daily life things The main point is that I actually do what the reminders tell me to do Unless I really don't have the spoons to do it at that time then I move that task to the next day so it will remind me again My kiddo tho she is 13 She refuses to use any sort of reminder app Even tho she's always on her phone so the best way to remind her is a phone notification Reasons why phone notifications work for me too We both also use written reminders on the fridge We have a list for each day of what needs done But because I don't often look at that list I use the phone But the fridge list is there as a backup in case I miss a phone notification Then comes my kid who doesn't use the phone reminders and doesn't look at the fridge So it's just me and her dad having to remind her of everything Every little thing from homework to feeding the cats showering brush teeth change your dang underwear etc again I get it I'm the same way but I use the tools I mentioned so I can be a better human for my own self I don't mind reminding her of things but dang it I have all my own crap to remember it's hard to remember all of hers too And not just remind her once but remind her 10 times for any one task plus care for myself and our home and our other 2 kiddos etc Its so much for my brain to remember I just wish she would TRY to get things done on her own Help Teens with ADHD,ADHD
143,I've struggled to eat enough vegetables through my entire adult life And it's not that I don't like them I love a good salad and I will go to town on some carrot sticks and hummus But all of the steps that I thought were required in vegetable consumption kept me from eating enough of them I had it in my head that the only right way to eat vegetables was to buy raw whole veggies and prepare them myself I thought that buying anything pre-cut or anything prepared was in some weird way cheating or lazy But it turns out you can just buy a party tray of pre-cut veggies and no one will stop you And I pick up a few salad kits where everything for a salad is included in the bag every time I'm at the grocery store I've even started buying these little packages of sliced apples and peanut butter intended for children Cutting out the steps that keep me from supporting my own wellbeing isn't cheating and it isn't lazy I wish I would have realized that sooner How I got myself to eat more vegetables,ADHD

170,How do I support my partner without losing my mind How can I support my partner in general How can I be more empathetic If I don't keep up with cleaning we would live like hoarders animal feces bugs flying around I've hurt myself falling on random things not able to move around the house freely my partner will tell me to stay upstairs until they clean xyz I literally feel like a prisoner in a room sometimes I do clean up after the animals but they are not mine and I am tired The animal thing HAS gotten better though I've convinced them to go to a therapist they were trying to get diagnosed but that has not been helpful I think a therapist can help in managing symptoms until a good doctor who can diagnose is found I'm just trying to be empathetic while staying sane and helping with solutions Supporting Partner Advice,ADHD
171,It's easier for me to completely avoid activities I'm prone to engaging with compulsively than to partake in them with moderation I'm guessing most people with ADHD agree For example food hello intermittent fasting social media shopping alcohol caffeine socializing at work and especially any hyper-focus inducing activity I find it easier to avoid stores and easier to delete all social media apps rather than engage responsibly I don't even miss whatever it when abstaining It gives me sense of control Unfortunately the all-or-nothing approach isn't sustainable I don't really crave these activities but find it almost IMPOSSIBLE TO REGULATE once started I've tried timers and limits but once the dopamine starts flowing I'll think to myself that I deserve to continue partaking because it's enjoyable or this time will be an exception fuck it etc Stimulants have helped me avoid known compulsive activities but doesn't seem to help regulating them I sometimes wonder if they've made my hyper-focus more intense I know the answer will involve accountability to myself or others and if it were problematic behaviors I could enlist my family to help keep me on track but the behaviors themselves aren't problematic it's that I find it overwhelmingly-difficult to moderate pleasurable activities when I know I should If it provides that dopamine drip my brain is locked in and nothing else matters TLDR I'm looking for a strategy or plan to moderate compulsive behaviors when I know it's time for me to stop Tips Advice When abstinence is easier than moderation I need some tips for indulging responsibly in engrossing activities behaviors,ADHD

177,So there s no Elvanse anywhere 40mg downwards I was under an ADHD clinic in one UK county but then moved to another county about 1 hour away 3 years ago I couldn t switch GPs to my new house s location as it would put me out of the catchment area for the clinic and put me on their waiting list despite being under their care for a long time The waiting list for the adhd clinic in my current home was 2 5 years but recently due to the massive rise in diagnoses they ve stopped accepting new ones altogether As someone who s luckily fairly physically healthy I rarely have to see a doctor so I don t have to pay constant train fares to get treatment and my prescriptions get sent to a pharmacy near where I live Then recently a triple whammy occurred I was suddenly out of work and unable to pay for much outside the basics Medication was suddenly out of supply and have struggled for the last couple of months without it and thus struggling to get my life in order I had a cancer scare and had to switch to a GP in my current county so they could see me warranting having to switch away from my old GP and removing any ability I currently have to receive medication I m normally one for not wanting to complain about my struggles as others have them worse amongst other reasons but I just wanted to get this off my chest I m sure it ll be okay But I feel helpless Just lost my access to medication permanently in an unfortunate set of circumstances,ADHD

196,Hi I don t really know where I m going with this post I just need to vent a little bit I guess also excuse my English as I m not a native speaker I m not yet diagnosed with ADHD I have a diagnostic interview scheduled next week and I feel its a 50 50 chance I actually fit enough criteria The thing is I am a clinical psychologist myself and I ve diagnosed a lot of clients with ADHD I ve always felt I recognized a lot of the examples of struggles clients told me during these interviews to the point that I often jokingly told colleagues that I might have ADHD myself ha-ha and often got the response that a lot felt the same about themselves so I didnt really give it any thought This has been going on for a few years now and last year I started a 2-year postmaster course to get proper licencing Since last january I got a lot of supervision and guidance by different experienced therapists and it became more apparent that I have trouble organising my work cant finish mundane administrative tasks and work a lot slower than other colleagues I ve always felt I m just lazy and should put more effort into it dating back to primary school This probably resulted in having a fear of failure and a low self esteem Now because I can function on an avarage okay level for the most part of my life and work I feel I kind of have to aggravate the symptoms to deserve the diagnosis I worry my therapist will be extra critical in scoring the criteria because I m so familliar with them I m sure that s not the right mindset to have I just want to be able to accept my inabilities more and function like most other people seem to and I m hoping medication and counseling will help me with that Feeling I don t have the right to get diagnosed with ADHD,ADHD

200,So I'm out of the psy from my diagnosis 30yo M and I'm apparently full on She didn't gave me the official results yet but there is no doubt and already talked about medication options I spent my whole life denying that adhd was real or only for extreme cases not actively speaking against it or anything but it was in my head because I have those issues and I don't complain about them so everyone MUST feel the same I realised that not only it was unfair of me but I also delayed what could be a fair improvement on my life and those around me My fiancee helped me see that I was wrong about my stance on Adhd and to seek help I'm a bit lost at the moment but we'll see what the future holds I guess Sorry for this not very useful post but needed to get it out somewhere Edit Thank you all for the support I didn't even expected a response and instead I got an avalanche of heartwarming comment I think I spent 20years online and never got as much message as today I don't think I'll be able to answer everyone but I've read everything and it helped a lot Thanks again you beautiful people Apologies from an unbeliever,ADHD
201,ndx partner claims to have ADHD but I am now suspicious it s actually covert NPD After some research I have come to understand that traits can overlap but the only thing that throws me off is that my partner is capable at work and is able to hold a job Said job requires great attention to detail organizational skills and time management and my partner doesn t seem to have any issues at work but for some reason at home the adhd kicks in My partner ignores me no emotional intimacy no physical intimacy They have issues with addiction porn video games smoking Also has passive aggressive tendencies I have tried to address the problems many many times but always felt like it fell on deaf ears Does this sound like ADHD or am I dealing with a narc ADHD Covert NPD or both,ADHD

208,One of the best and worst aspects of adhd for me is the difficulty of mundane tasks like cleaning or grocery shopping or laundry Often times I let these things pile up However at the end of the week I ll get a burst of energy to do all of these things at once and it feels so good Like I m checking off a quest list I get filled with so much dopamine and finally I can stop stressing But then a few days later it s all pilled up again and I lack the ability to do it until I get that energy burst again I love finishing mundane tasks,ADHD
209,Hear me out damnit I have seen a lot of posts and comments from people lately that all tend to boil down to a general theme along the lines of I officially have ADHD but im scared of meds due to a stigma I was raised with Please give me a path that doesnt involve me taking medication because THESE meds mean im a weak minded failure So I know that may be so on the nose that you can see hair but I need to be direct for a minute amp x200B First and foremost Medication for ADHD is a normal healthy primary method of managing this neurological condition I mean come on you wouldnt try to avoid medication if you find out you have heart disease high blood pressure or diabetes ADHD is no different Second you are not weak for deciding to get on meds You are in fact giving yourself a higher chance at a better life https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC6697582 https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC6697582 While this study openly admits to needing more data to have a better view its preliminary findings show that medicated ADHD people have lower risk of injury automotive accidents aka longer life expectancy and better results in education Stop handicapping yourself Third be kind to yourself Stop talking down to yourself for taking or needing medication You are not lesser of a person you have a condition that needs managing Information on our condition is still small as research into it has only JUST last 5-10 years started to kick off and be analyzed We are learning new things every day but one thing has been proven over and over Medication is the most extensive and powerful tool at managing ADHD They arent a perfect solution but its better than being miserable or dead amp x200B I hope everyone goes into 2024 being aware and kind to yourself May your year be filled with professional and personal success Stop avoiding medication Down with the stigma,ADHD
210,Need advice I recently began working for a company where I am tasked with recording the phone numbers of various individuals with their personal details As someone with ADHD and OCD I find this incredibly difficult Yesterday my peers were able to record 60 to 100 profiles whereas I only managed to record about 26 profiles I have noticed that this is so because I spend quite a lot of time re-checking numbers and details to make sure they are accurate The monotonous and tedious nature of the job only made the entire situation worse because I will try to take short breaks after focusing for probably 2 hours non-stop but that short break evolves into a much longer one Halfway through the day literally all my energy and motivation has been sucked dry The problem is that it is not only taking a toll on my mental health but physical health as well as my self-esteem The fact that I don t even remotely come close to the targets makes it all the worse I feel so useless compared to other people I feel inadequate and even though I try to work twice as hard it is never enough Not even remotely close to enough To add to that the fact that people don t see how hard you re working makes it all the worse I am seen as this slacker but that couldn t be more further from the truth Alas I don t know what to do Do I slow down and try to gradually work myself up Should I keep on pushing more and more Should I quite the job even though I know that will just make everything worse because I will feel like a quitter Hence I need advice motivation anything Advice on how to cope with ADHD in the work place,ADHD

237,Hi everyone I m seeking advice and insights on a challenging situation I m facing in my relationship I ve been with my partner for nearly 7 years and we have two amazing children Our relationship has been a rollercoaster marked by periods of breaking up and getting back together Throughout this time I ve felt misunderstood particularly in regard to my ADHD Many of our issues revolve around intimacy my need for affirmation and her lack of compliments When I express my vulnerabilities she perceives it as self-pity which is disheartening She s aware of what triggers me and sometimes provokes these reactions intentionally In moments of anger she has called the police leaving me feeling trapped and uncertain about how to handle these situations When I was unemployed and struggling with anxiety and depression she was more supportive However her attitude shifted when I took initiative in my life by starting a cleaning company growing it successfully without a formal business plan or marketing budget Now she s increasingly critical and dismissive She often tells me I m hard to love and that my behavior isn t normal comparing me unfavorably to other people with ADHD I m at a crossroads unsure how to move forward particularly with the potential challenges of co-parenting My biggest fear is that she might try to turn our children against me I m also concerned about the impact on our children if I were to start a new family in the future I don t want them to feel like they re second priority I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights from this community Has anyone experienced something similar How did you manage it or help your partner shift their perspective to see and love you for who you are Any guidance on dealing with these complex relationship dynamics and co-parenting issues would be extremely helpful Thank you for taking the time to read and respond Navigating Relationship Challenges with ADHD,ADHD

258,Hey everyone Just feeling a little frustrated I was medicated for ADHD from ages 7-22 so basically as long as I can remember Last year I graduated from college Since leaving school I haven t been able to be on medication for financial reasons and having trouble finding a psychiatrist I feel so unproductive unmotivated and exhausted all the time Medication allowed me to be productive even without getting adequate food or sleep due to the side effects of many stimulants I know that wasn t healthy but when you ve been on a medication since you were 7 and that s your life it s just what it was for me Now actually having to eat throughout the day for energy and not having the what use to feel like a never ending supply of energy has been difficult for me to adjust to I hate feeling tired and makes me so frustrated with myself To me feeling tired is the worst feeling in the world Anyway just venting It s been a hard adjustment I was medicated for 15 years and getting off this past year has been rough,ADHD
259,For reasons I would rather not disclose my ADHD symptoms have gotten pretty severe in the last six months I have fallen behind significantly at work missing plenty of deadlines and new opportunities Especially in the past month I have had full days of ADHD paralysis and actually got nothing done Not only that but on those days I did not respond to a single email I am working with my doctor and therapist to adjust my medication and start CBT and things are already a bit better but I know that a conversation is coming in the office I do not know how to credibly explain what has been happening to me to management I have tried drafting ways of expressing that I have ADHD and was suffering from anxiety paralysis that I am working on dealing with without sounding like I'm saying I was relaxing and not doing work because I wanted a pay check in exchange for no labor I know of course that that's not what happened but my fear is that they will see it that way Can anyone suggest language you have used in the workplace to talk about ADHD and how it affects you TIA How to Explain ADHD Paralysis to my Higher-Ups,ADHD
260,I've been struggling with productivity massively the adrenaline that an upcoming deadline and the resulting detriment to not doing it doesn't prevent me from not being able to get things done anymore I sit there with a task I find boring and it feels like the hardest thing to do in the world even if easy to do My life errands keep getting missed I'm so disorganised and I only seem to be able to act when a simple errand snowballs into something much much worse The above is making my life hell work feels so anxiety provoking and my personal life is utter chaos There's redeemable things about me I'm ultra creative passionate personable empathic and have hyper interest in things I love like the gym sports etc I struggle to sit and do 15 mins of vital admin at work but can spend 5 hours reading about a football players career or the history of weight lifting etc that perhaps doesn't serve me or help me at all especially when I will have more pressing matters to attend to I want to achieve two things 1 How do I get things done at work What methods should I try 2 How do I reduce the shame I feel about how my mind works Shame Reduction How to be okay with myself,ADHD
261,I can't for the life of me get myself together to do stuff I procrastinate constantly and put off tasks till the very last minute My therapist told me I need to visualize my time so that I can see how much of my day I have left I can't seem to find a cool desktop clock that visualizes time with LED's in a circle or something like that Anybody have something similar that helps them A desk clock that visualizes time,ADHD
262,Okay so I've been dealing with this for a couple of months now and I'm only now writing this to see if this is a common occurrence I'm a single queer woman I used to enjoy going on dates especially via dating apps I've met some good and some bad folks there as one does But over the last few months every date I've been on with a man had left me in tears Tbf they're not all necessarily terrible Some even nice folks But as soon as they touch my hand I feel the need to recoil I can't maintain much eye contact thanks to the splash of autism as well but now more than ever because I just feel uncomfortable in their presence With other queer folks my anxiety gets the better of me sometimes but that's not new Has anyone else been struggling with dating and intimacy in general Feeling Unsafe on Dates,ADHD

264,I find myself constantly daydreaming about doing literally anything other than working for someone else Something where I m running my own business not having to report to anyone or be micromanaged not having incredibly strict deadlines In my 9-5 I find myself losing track of time without getting anything done then I m stuck in a panic loop to the point of getting physically sick I just can t seem to get it together Ultimately my goal has always been to become yoga certified and own a studio but I m questioning whether I m being overly ambitious thinking I could be in front of people all day like that Does anyone have any tips or suggestions or just anything at all I m feeling so stuck I need something creative and to top things off I m a single mom of two with not much financial support Need out of 9-5,ADHD
265,I've always thought of myself as a mildly creative person without any significant talent in any given discipline Whenever I learn a new skill I'm usually average I guess but I never excell or have the patience to git gud Learning that I have ADHD makes sense to me in that regard but it doesn't change the fact that I'm feeling creatively trapped I can never get good enough in something to truly express my creativity as I either lose focus or just realize that this wasn't my thing When I look at writers musicians and artists I'm really envious of having that opportunity to express your creativity and to not have that or atleast the proper motivation to get it is really disheartening And of course I know that these guys who have that have been practicing their skills for an x number of years I just wish that I could start my own journey as well I don't know if anybody else shares this way of thought or not but I felt like I needed to say it Jack of all trades master of none,ADHD
266,I don t post here often because all the posts I ve made didn t garner any attention However this is something that is mind blowing and I need to share I 29F have been with my SO 33M for four years Many ups and downs like any couple We moved to another state about a year and a half into our relationship as we couldn t afford even a one bedroom apartment back home We both found work adopted a dog and things seemed to be moving forward Things crashed when we moved into our home He lost his job and has been struggling to find another for two years He spiraled and has grown reclusive and angry Something he was holding onto was a therapist telling him and his mother when he was a teen that he would never have the ability to live alone He thought this is what they meant Finally he agreed to have a neuropsychiatric evaluation done The results were validating and made him understand what he s been going through isn t him being lazy or not being capable First of all his IQ is 119 His cognitive functions all but processing were in superior ranges for his age Processing is lower not by much but I had the same problem He was diagnosed with hyperactive type ADHD unspecified bipolar disorder with clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder All of these untreated have caused a massive dysfunction and paralysis They also suggested he needs to be evaluated for Autism Spectrum Disorder which his mother told me was always something she suspected but his doctors never referred him as a child Seeing this has made him so happy because it can be treated It s not all in his head It s not excuses It s real but he can get help Four years of struggling with anger towards himself now watered down to frustration and relief Help is available Help is necessary It s okay to need it It really is so important to have a full neuropsychiatric evaluation as an adult,ADHD
267,Looking for inspiration and upgrades for 2024 I'll go first for context I have my own business consulting for the food industry remotely as a food scientist amp x200B I focus on working solely three days a week to get the most work done and put a lot more deadline pressure on myself Otherwise projects end up dragging across five days needlessly amp x200B I try to minimize meeting times to specific blocks in the day They completely exhaust me and I end up losing a lot of productivity on those days when I have back-to-back meetings amp x200B I usually do 30 to 60-minute blocks where I switch between project work marketing and finances Marketing is great for days where I'm hyperactive and looking for a distraction Finances are good times when I have low energy and need a low-paced activity Project work well always finding a way to procrastinate amp x200B I try to take Ritalin only once a month for extremely sluggish days where I have to face down a long-term project Otherwise have been experimenting with workouts 2x a week with running walking with the dogs whenever I need to take a physical break amp x200B I pace when I talk on the phone which helps get my ideas out faster and with more clarity amp x200B I've learned to charge on a project fee basis based on the amount of energy it takes to deal with an issue after a few years I started to notice that it didn't make sense to charge hourly since there were tasks I could do very quickly but I could return a lot of value in a short period of time So clients get charged a premium for projects and activities I perceive as tedious for myself amp x200B I'm beginning to do more volunteer work with younger students in high school and college I like their equally frenetic energy and low attention span ADHDers who are entrepreneurs and business owners what's your routine stack,ADHD

269,It's genuinely crazy and confusing to me that everyone pretends that there's no other way Like if you take out lunch and random chitchats the 8 hour work day is easily six hours If I had the flexibility to work how I wanted I would work 2 hours in the morning two hours in the evening and two hours in the afternoon and between that I would do my chores my side projects and my hobbies I am hyper fixating on why this is not a reality while I suffer sitting at a desk in a grey box for 8 hours a day I like my work but I simply cannot wrap my head around the lifestyle EDIT Thank you to everyone who commented I feel so much less alone I actually want to respond to a few points that kept coming up 1 I work in an extremely old extremely mail dominated field that is SO resistant to ANY type of chance I LOVE the career I love the work I just hate the structure and the culture 2 My job has WFH two days a week but I was not allowed to do it because I didn't do well on my first evaluation mostly ADHD symptoms 3 I came from an extremely low income background so yes I am trying to start my own business but I do need to put food on the table until that takes off Also I cannot go for a lower paying job for the same reason Additionally if I want to start my own business in my line of work I need to work in an office for some years to get licensed Again I actually like my line of work just not the lifestyle 4 Lastly I appreciate everyone who empathized with me That was the purpose of this post I believe life would get better once I get medicated and I have more support in my personal life Getting medicated is just it's own terrible process I cannot wrap my head around the 9-5,ADHD

272,My daughter had an appointment this morning at 8am I forgot about it I was all proud because we got out of the house on time and I pulled into work early at 8 02 and then saw the calendar notification I called the office and they can see her at 9 30 so she can still have her appointment but I feel so guilty The office is an hour away and I already used so much gas bringing her to daycare and now I have to go back and get her Adhd tax I never forget appointments and I haven t missed any doses of my medication I just wish my brain worked I forgot my daughters appointment,ADHD
273,I have trouble with my adhd medication The thing is that vyvanse is definitely working but not really in a helpful way When I take my medication I feel very motivated afterwards kinda like hyperfixation feels but I can stop whatever I'm doing if I want to My problem is that I can't control my motivation It leads to me sending voice notes to friends or talking to someone in person or on the phone way too much Every topic suddenly feels super interesting and I can talk about it for hours on end if you let me Also thousands of ideas pop into my head about what I can do what I want to do plans ideas things to research etc Also things that I forgot I had to do but I'm too excited about all the other ideas to actually follow through I manage to at least write all the ideas down tho It's fun but it isn't what I want the medication to do and leads to me being even more unproductive than without medication as I lose hours of productive time by researching useless things even though I have more important things to do It can help me focus when I have something super important to do that has to be done now or I'm going to get into trouble but otherwise I have huge problems actually directing the motivation onto useful things Can someone tell me how to direct my motivation towards useful things Vyvanse and talking too much,ADHD

278,non-English speaker sorry for any mistakes I F42 have received my official ADHD diagnosis two months ago I was put on Strattera at the same time and it does help However lately I'm experiencing a feeling of hopelessness the sense that everything is futile and no matter how I try I'll continue to struggle and eventually f up everything because it's how my brain is wired that can't be changed It feels like some kind of seal on my fate and it is really overwhelming Is this a normal course of feelings after getting diagnosed Will it pass Is there a way to battle it Right now I'm not even sure that I can make adult decisions any more Though I'm definitely high-functioning as they label it Lost hope after getting diagnosed,ADHD
279,Hello I 18m is currently on the deciding whether making an appointment myself without my parents because they are not having third chances I had 2 previous appointments actually the earlier one basically just prescribed meds for my depression didn't know ADHD at that time and the latter one last year said I have a decent coping mechanisms even though I checked many of the symptoms of ADHD and just prescribed me with vitamins and the issue was I need my personality developed I am basically shy and has massive stage fright and referred me to some online programs that I need to register in which I forgot until yesterday I realized too late I might have underreported my problems On the latter appointment Idk what my parents said when the psychiatrist left me outside by myself at the second half of it Right now I am now in college and doing atrociously my sleep cycle is abhorrent too much last minute activities forgetting important items to bring 0 score in 3 assignments because I did not press the submit button on Google Classroom and subconsciously delaying myself in doing projects They mentioned my grades were almost always B to A back in high school that ADHD is highly unlikely I think I only survived this long is because of my hyperfocus and the panic mode coping mechanisms I'd developed but I don't want it anymore and it's making me miserable also it seems to not be working as effectively anymore I had not received my grades yet but I have a sinking feeling it tanked I wanna get this issue of mine over with and not come underprepared on the next appointment Idk if this is tmi or not but fuck it Preparations for the appointment,ADHD

286,Hi Does anyone else HATE bluetooth earbuds The fact phones nowadays dont even bother to come with headphone jacks is abysmal I say this because as you know ADHD makes you forget a lot of shit and my bluetooth earbuds are feckin small even inside the case I always ALWAYS misplace them and because i have autism too I am forced to go outside and get overstimulated I know I could probably buy a pair of big headphones instead probably way less harder to loose but I'm nervous theyll draw attention to me in public plus they're also so expensive its like man i miss the days of just cheap wired headphones you could buy from the corner shop Biggest annoyance,ADHD
287,TLDR Burned out from too much going on in life have dealt with a lot of anxiety stress symptoms as a result since then Elvanse changed my life but since my burnout no longer gives me the motivation and desire to do things Have been taking Elvanse 2 years Hello so yes I burnt out a little over a year ago Oct 2022 and now I am back working full time and doing alright But Elvanse vyanse just quite doesn't help me the way it used to I can focus but the motivation and happiness to be able to do things just aren't there I try not to think about it too much but I just came to miss it today I know I still have anxiety since I have palpitations every day and that might very well be the cause I've thought of doing a vacation break from meds but I'm scared of withdrawals and scared if I can manage my life at all Just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences and if you maybe had succes in getting Elvanse to work properly again Burnout amp meds no longer as effective,ADHD

290,I am having this issue where I cannot sleep at all for months Having 2-3 hours per day For reference I am working with my psychiatrist on finding a sleep medication for a while I have ADHD and autism and I have an undiagnosed MAJOR skin issue that makes my entire skin full of scratches bruises and extremely itchy and burning Every day when I try to sleep around 12pm-1am I put on my fan which then leads to trying to find the perfect position of needing it to cover all of my body Here recently when I do I put on rain noises I sleep without anything on as to help evenly spread the fan and I hate the feeling of clothes touching my skin I lay down with my stuffed animal don t judge I am not a child and just cant sleep for literately hours I find myself constantly making noises with my mouth touching my walls and blankets scratching as I feel itchy and it just feels good as texture picking at my skin and hair looking around constantly repositioning myself moving blankets etc This has been an ongoing process for months I feel so understimulated while trying to sleep im usually a very busy person How can I be stimulated enough where I am not uncomfortable and off but still sleep P S I have over 20 throw blankets that I use as like an incline on my bed Everything is washed properly and in the correct way for my skin so it is not irritation from those causing me to be itchy I am constantly itchy throughout the day but it is 1000 times worse at night as I am understimulated and looking for things to feel And the rain noises is also for stimulation I cannot do music as I will be too focused on it to sleep at all I need noise which there is plenty of in my room without music noise Please don t bring in religion or religious practices as a response these are big trigger for me Understimulated during sleel,ADHD
291,I love driving especially long distances with some good music For some reason this relaxes me so much that I can suddenly let my mind wander in piece again like I used to before depression and anxiety hit me This helps me think about problems I usually avoid because they cause more anxiety or panic attacks and enables me to come up with creative solutions Unfortunately this means I have to either take a ton of breaks to write things down or bombard my wife with with weird incoherent voice messages If I just send them to myself I never listen to them again I also can't just drive a hundred kilometers every time I need an idea and I have a feeling that playing some kind of truck simulator or something similar will just not be the same I feel like it has something to do with mild boredem being bound to one place still getting somewhere in the process and so on I assume it is somehow related to default network activity in the brain maybe also related to EMDR Has anyone been able to create a similar effect in another way that is more practical Sports doesn't do the trick for me unfortunately I assume it might be possible through meditation but my success in that matter has been limited Any suggestions Why is driving so relaxing creativity enhancing and how do I recreate this effect at home,ADHD
292,I am in Melbourne Australia Just wondering if many of you have been asked to do a urine test for illegal drugs when seeing the GP for your first script My understanding is that the test is not mandatory Today I had a disconcerting first appointment with a GP after recently being diagnosed The GP had a lot of tone during the appointment I got the impression that he thought I may have sketchy reasons for seeking medication He said that he would not prescribe me both Vyvanse and Dex both prescribed by the psychiatrist and that I had to choose one or the other Overall his attitude towards me was a suspicious and condescending He said that the psychiatrist has requested that I have a urine test for illegal drugs when I get my other tests ECG etc The psychiatrist said nothing about a urine test but did mention the other tests amp x200B I have no history of drug abuse whatsoever I'll be changing to another GP Just wondering how many other folks out there get asked to do a urine test for illegal drugs when seeking adhd medication Edit my friend saw the same psychiatrist a month before me and was not asked to complete a urine test amp x200B Weird GP and required to do a urine test for illegal drugs when getting medication script in Australia,ADHD
293,Hi has anyone in the UK used the Fiona project to get diagnosed Their website seems too good to be true which is why I'm skeptical As well some things that don't line up 1 Their website says they're Cardiff based but the Facebook says London 2 The phone number advertised is actually an Egypt number 3 They advertise the cheap price as theyare a subsidiary of Newtel Ltd but as far as I can find that company dissolved in the UK in 2019 unless they mean the American company I can't figure out how to attach the photos showing this So anyone know how I can figure out if they're a legitimate company or if they've used them before Fiona Project legit,ADHD

312,I feel I have come up with a way to describe my ADHD to others At least from my perspective Does this sound right to others here At its core ADHD can be described as seeing everything as having equal importance or weight Watering your plants when it pops into your head is just as important as the paper you're writing for class due tomorrow Going through lists or a shelf of books is a nightmare because each thing in the list has exactly the same value as every other thing When you walk into a room and people see a mess you just see A Room with any item having an equal weight and right to be there compared to any other item The pile of old mail on the kitchen table is as a value judgement just as valid a thing to have on a table as a bouquet of flowers We switch subjects in mid sentence because what's the difference It's not that we can't FOCUS It's that everything is has basically EXACTLY the same level of importance That's why executive function is a problem Each task has the same level of urgency How do you CLASSIFY things and ORGANIZE things and PRIORITIZE things if all things are essentially the same as a value judgement On the rare occasions when something Suddenly Seems More Important it's like a glowing light in a dark room and then suddenly that's ALL WE SEE it's the hyper focus you hear about How I describe my ADHD to others,ADHD

329,I ve tried so many different stimulants mg extended release instant you name it and I have yet to find the right fit was diagnosed and medicated May 2021 it s been a long journey trying to find the right fit but i m just done looking for advice support from those who have completely stopped stimulants before I continue yes i m in talks with my dr over this how long did it take you to be ok off of them did you have withdrawals taper off or cold turkey just curious how others have gone through this process Stopping Stimulants,ADHD
330,I m starting the titration process for methylphenidate very soon and was wondering if anyone could answer a question for me I m unsure how much of this is down to adhd And how much is just the way I am but I find I really struggle with being alone I guess I find being with people stimulating and I m able to relax physically somewhat when I m in company because I love to talk pretty much all of this time Im a really social person and enjoy being around people as much as possible but recently since moving and living alone for the first time I ve found being alone even for very small periods horrible It s like I instantly feel so lonely even though I ve been around people all day Basically I m interested to see if anyone else is similar and whether being medicated helps with this at all Hoping that when I start then I ll be able to chill out a bit and not get immediately bored when alone or maybe be able to engage in more chill activities and not have to be so active all the time which will take away the anxiety associated with being alone Hoping this is an adhd related thing and not just a fundamental part of my personality Methylphenidate MR,ADHD

335,One of my New Years resolution is to build stronger friendships I 24f currently live at home with my mother who has been pretty invasive and controlling over me and my social life for most of my life Because of that I've kinda learned to suppress my desire to go out or talk to people The pandemic made it even worse I have two or three friends acquaintances that I'd like to build stronger friendships with but the desire to have bonds doesn't feel natural to me anymore Everytime I see a text from one of them it feels like work I know that I like these people because when I can muster up the energy I can get into the groove of having a conversation and feeling like I did as a teenager with my friends when I saw them at school But it's very hard most times to even answer texts I see the notification and it immediately feels like a task has been put in front of me It feels more like i'm pressing buttons on my phone to fulfill the role of friendship than actually building friendship I work remotely full-time and I don't see people in-person very often If I do it's usually been for more event type of things than simple casual time I feel like its a combination of my ADHD and my living situation I'm hoping to move out by next year to try and get a new start but I want to start building stronger friendships now What are some strategies on how to treat friendship and social interaction so that it doesn't feel like a chore I'm doing How do I stop seeing social interaction as work,ADHD
336,I have ALWAYS been horrible at managing my money it's one of my big kickers I can typically use the coping mechanisms I've learned through the years to do other things that are hard i e laundry cleaning etc but money management has always gotten the better of me Anyone have any podcasts or other management resources tips that works well for you Tracking spending and making budgets has always been a flop and just leads to more frustration TYIA Best financial podcasts for adhd,ADHD
337,instead of a cleaner because the business was called Helping Hands and it was just across the road where I was shopping and I walked in and asked if they cleaned and they said yes and I somehow didn't notice all the brochures of old people about the place It was supposed to just be a single deep clean to get my place up to par for a party but they would've added a surcharge for one-offs since they usually only do regular scheduling But they assured me I could cancel anytime and I figured sure I'll cancel after my party and that was two months ago Anyway it turns out it's one of the best ADHD-taxes I've ever committed The first person was really efficient but judgemental since I'm obviously not a disabled senior citizen but thanks to some rescheduling I have someone who not only is similar to my age but is also from my culture As a social worker who's been studying clinical psychology on the side she's actually super understanding of my executive dysfunction and treats me like a real person instead of a failure like I expected and that's really nice She comes over every couple of weeks for a few hours and we go about my home cleaning stuff together I have so much trouble getting my ass kicked into gear so having someone I barely know come into my house gets my anxiety up enough to putter about tidying things She has no problem cleaning the stuff I can't bear to touch encourages and praises me for finishing a cleaning task on my own and we even get to practice my native language while we're at it It isn't cheap no but I feel a lot better with my home being neater so I'm less likely to get depressed so I'm more likely to get up and be productive I call that a fair trade for having less to deposit in my savings account I accidentally hired a carer,ADHD
338,Does anyone else impulsively do things while also being actively aware that nothing you re impulsively doing will make the situation better but you re just aware and kind of watching things play out from that impulsive response I feel sometimes that I m unable to stop myself after I ve placed said self in physical and mental motion All the while I am conscious of my incorrect response but somehow the impulsivity wins out and I find myself doing things I would advise others not to and later think of as wasted time Idk if that makes sense but I m starting to learn about my personal sensory overload and with the holidays I feel intermittent sensory overload and among other overwhelming feelings that I m learning to put into words Do you ever just go with it and shrug as you actively watch yourself do the wrong thing I feel crazy,ADHD
339,I very often forget to take my medication When I take it after awhile the side effects are always horrible On stimulants I get really sick the first day Today I just restarted my Qelbree lowest dose so it s not like I restarted a high dose and have to work it back up and my heart feels like it s beating out of my chest my mouth is dry asf my head is foggy i m nauseous i m not even rly typing clearly It s only bad the FIRST day Why Is it normal Why is the first day back on meds so bad,ADHD

341,Apologies if these sort of questions have been asked but I find the topics might be very specific to individuals My daughter is almost 7 and we are in the process of getting an ADHD diagnosis for her as to myself it is clear as day She has both aspects and in spades School is becoming harder and harder for her to get engagement in class for obvous reasons and although her teacher is amazing at trying to be accommodating it is clear she is struggling and falling behind her peers The SENCO is aware and is going through the process and due to the NHS being the way it is Its roughly 2 years for assessment and diagnosis We recently had an meeting with the Head teacher Who's sagely advice consisted of we don't have the resources to deal and also an option would be for her to go part time These seem ridiculous to me I've researched this as you do but thought it might be nice to engage with people who have experience with this personally and any advice to potentially get my daughter to realise her potential more I appreciate everyone is different and there are so many subtle variables to each individual as to how they work but any advice would be appreciated Thank you kindly in advance We're in the UK and we've only started the process for diagnosis in the last few months Advice to help with my daughter,ADHD

345,So I haven't been diagnosed but my prescriber felt it was worth trying Adderall for my symptoms 3 months ago I started Adderall XR and a month later switched to IR dosing between 10-30mg I felt like it added some calmness but over time I feel like that could have been all in my head and really was just making me drowsy Even being at 30mg and realizing no improvement in focus and concentration made me wonder if there was any truth to brand name Adderall being more effective vs generic Anyway about a week ago I switched to brand name and noticed that it could be more potent My mouth was a lot dryer and I've been thirstier Also this knocks me out Way more than the generic I realized it is actually not going to work for me as it just puts me to sleep From this experience it's hard to understand how anyone can abuse it or see value as a study drug Just thought it would help to share for those considering the differences Adderall Brand vs Generic,ADHD

354,I've been on a mission to improve brain health for a long time now and sugar has been the hardest thing to work on consistently If my dopamine levels are sub normal at baseline due to ADHD and I then restrict sugar I feel as if this exacerbates my ADHD further I see this to be evident as I seem to go through remarkable downturns when curbing sugar This is particularly noticeable when I must perform to the best of my ability at work which involves constant problem solving One of the main symptoms of withdraw I despise is when my ability to communicate linguistically is impaired When I'm feeling good my error rate in speech is minimal though still more than anyone typical However when I'm withdrawing from something of the unknown suspecting sugar or my brain is just going through the motions I can wake up and just feel spacey hazy Like I've had a sip of whiskey and maintain that feeling all day or another analogy would be like my brain in the search for words is like going from a 5g search for words to a 3g search for words My enthusiasm isn't there I lose my passion energy and ability to work to the best of my ability I'm suspecting impaired homeostasis when cutting back on sugar however I'm skeptical in putting it all down to my sugar intake but I also wouldn't be surprised if sugar was the main issue and I just need to be adhering to a more consistent diet with restricted sugars whether that be via restricting carbs amp or sweeteners of any sort What do you think and what are your experiences amp symptoms when cutting back giving up something you are were addicted to Thank you kindly How do you feel psychologically when giving up or cutting back on sugar,ADHD

357,In a nutshell the summary of my neuropsych test said I have all the hallmark symptoms of adhd other than hyperactivity but because I also have a diagnosis of anxiety i could not be diagnosed with ADHD Essentially they blame all my issues on my anxiety Has anyone else had this happen Neuropsych test,ADHD
358,I was on Vyvanse It was amazing I've never in my entire life been able to focus with so much ease I stopped coming home in the afternoons and taking a 6 hour nap because I hadn't mentally exhausted myself all day trying to focus The only downside was that I was hard to be around at home My doctor switched me to Adderall which was okay but nowhere near the level of focus I achieved on Vyvanse and with some of the same negative moods Now I'm supposed to start trying Azstarys and I hope to God it works For 2 months now it's like swimming through quicksand to work not being able to focus or concentrate on my work for even 5 minutes straight I'm getting nothing done and I feel awful I try to work and I either get overwhelmed or lost on what I was doing and it's taking a toll on me physically because I'm starting to panic-force myself into working I never had to do that on Vyvanse and I miss the focus the love for my job that's now being overshadowed by guilt and feelings of inferiority because I can't function normally I'm just nervous because if I get on it and it doesn't work will a higher dose of Vyvanse be the solution Or will it make me bitch out even worse than the last time I just want to be able to function again and excel at my job the way I used to Hoping Azstarys works,ADHD
359,Don't think I'm looking for treatment information or anything like that it's a more ephemeral question how do you deal I don't just mean ADHD itself fun as that is I mean trying for years and years to get treatment without success in my case no medicine has had any effect at all good or bad I mean being part of an age group that was forgotten in childhood on Ritalin and then forgotten in adulthood while legions of younger people seem to have an easy time of getting help Or easier at least It's not those specific issues but the weight those issues apply to people To me I can't even start thinking about ADHD help without instantly feeling intensely angry and hurt most of the time and that's not a state I want to be in I don't like resenting myself I don't like resenting society in general I don't like resenting an entire decade casting people aside because they weren't good enough set-pieces for Boomer parents I'd certainly LIKE to enjoy things I'd like to be able to see the positives of this situation I'd like to have even a shred of hope that I have any chance at all before being written off entirely I'd like to be more efficacious in my career without having to constantly fight with schedule reminders and getting basic tasks done that don't fall under that magical Goldilocks Zone of Interesting enough to do not so tedious to drop it I don't know if there's anyone like me left anymore Weird as it sounds to say I hope not But if there is how do you deal How do you not just give up on this How Do People Deal,ADHD

366,I have been completely devouring this book since it came out yesterday and I absolutely love it It's got a great mix of stories to relate to and actional information Full disclosure I have been a fan of hers and her YouTube channel for quite a while so there may be some bias I have read listened to a fair few books on the topic and my takeaway generally with a couple exceptions obviously has been that they were written by medical professionals speaking to other medical pros or adults of ADHD children this book is not that It really does feel like reading something written to support and educate an adult without being filled with difficult to parse language or technical lingo It didn't feel like being talked down to by some higher authority or guru more like having the concepts explained by a knowledgeable friend who shares the same struggles I probably will need another day or so to finish but at 40 in I would definitely give it a solid recommend just based on what I have read so far Has anyone else got the book yet have thoughts about it How to ADHD by Jessica McCabe has been released first impressions,ADHD
367,I write fiction for fun but I ve been struggling to engage with it lately even though I want to My meds are at a good place I ve discussed this with my therapist My main issue is I have SO many ideas for novels I want to write Sometimes I try combining ideas Sometimes I try making a pros and con a of each idea Sometimes I try a new idea if I think I m ruminating Sometimes I get stuck in outlining Sometimes I abandon drafts However I have a handful of ideas that have remained in my mind throughout the years I think those ideas are probably good ones to pursue since they hold my interest But even within that subset I still have several options Do I need to find a system for project hopping If you jump between projects how do you organize that Do you do something particular in your writing process like not using an outline that helps keep you engaged Any advice is much appreciated How do you choose creative projects,ADHD
368,Hi is my first time in this subreddit 20M I'm here because I pretty sure I might have adhd I still didn't go to a psychologist because my parents think that because I went as a child then I don't have something I started feeling pretty sensitive lately most of it when my mind is not distracted by friends or things that entretain me especially before sleeping the other night I decided to send a message to my bestfriend who also thinks I have adhd about me feeling down and wanting to meet someone because I'm carving affection from my last relationship but at morning I decided to delete the message because I still scared of telling him or that saying it might be wrong should I tell him how I feel I just don't want to look like someone who just wants attention I should tell my friends about my feelings when I'm feeling down,ADHD

370,Be kind to yourself If you clean in a kind of frenetic way that's ok If you don't finish organizing the closet today that's ok as long as you schedule another time to complete it There are ways that can help your brain clean the house and it's ok if you lean into your adhd strengths Here are some tips Start one room at a time from the leftmost room in your house to the right If you find things in one room that need to go somewhere else put it on the floor of that room if you have not cleaned it yet don't put it away Take breaks Toss your food in the microwave while you quickly spray down the shower Schedule your chores across the week The same chores on the same day of the week Schedule an admin day All the bills in a special drawer to tackle on Monday Phone calls and household meetings with your partner on this day Schedule a cheat day Thursdays all you have to do is take out the trash If cleaning the bathroom one day means top to bottom mopping included but today it means spraying wet and forget in just the baths also ok If you are bored of the routine of cleaning throw in an extra special project like organizing the pantry in there something you don't have to finish PSA There is no right way to clean your house,ADHD

393,Hi all I'm feeling a bit discouraged in my journey to finding the right dose and medication A few months ago I got diagnosed and started 20mg of Vyvanse I felt nothing no side effects and no benefit I still took it for 3 weeks to be sure and at my next doctor appointment I went up to 30mg From the first day of taking the 30mg I had noticeable side effects and after almost 2 weeks they haven't really died down Mostly I just feel off and I think the best way to describe it is like a mild to moderate hangover But I have also had restless sleep despite taking melatonin and bouts of nausea and headaches Aside from the side effects I still haven't felt much change in terms of my level of focus and distraction anxiety racing thoughts etc My next doctor's appointment is in 2 days but I made the decision today to stop taking the 30mg as I was tired of being uncomfortable I still had a couple 20s left so I've switched back to those in the hopes that its better than nothing and at least i have no side effects But I'm not sure where to go from here Apart of me feels like I need a higher dose still to get any benefit but I'm scared of the side effects getting worse at a higher dose Apart of me also feels like a quitter like maybe if I just stuck it out the side effects would eventually stop Curious if anyone else has had the same experience of 1 dose being seemingly too low but the next dose up maybe being too high I had such high expectations given all the success stories here but doesn't seem like that's going to be my experience 20mg Vyvanse too little but 30mg too much,ADHD

400,Hi everyone I am a 25-year-old woman who just got diagnosed with ADHD last week The psychologist who provided the testing recommended that I get put on ADHD medication and that I should reach out to my PCP to prescribe it I messaged my PCP office and they replied PCP's can prescribe the medication but not all do Dr _____ typically does not prescribe medication for ADHD and usually prefers a psychiatrist to manage ADHD If you would like to discuss it with her in detail you can call the office to schedule an appointment televisit I encourage you to contact a psychiatrist to schedule an appointment with them in the meantime since it can sometimes take a while to be seen I am feeling absolutely distraught It has taken me 2 years after my therapist recommended getting this evaluation to motivate myself to schedule it and go through with the testing Now I m just feeling defeated since my PCP seems to not care about her patients who have ADHD I just know it s going to be difficult for me to schedule anything with a psychiatrist and it s going to feel like another marathon to get prescribed medication I can t keep living like this What would be the better route Find a PCP who is willing to prescribe medication Or go the psychiatrist route PCP won t prescribe medication,ADHD

410,Today's WTF why do you hate people with ADHD rant from me not really seeking empathy just the closest relevant tag WHY do companies specifically in this case medical-provider companies use different account numbers for every visit I have my primary care doctor set up in my bank's bill pay system so that duh I can pay the bills when they come in since I can't really quite automate them I just got off the phone trying to figure out why they think I owe them money when I paid that bill two weeks ago Come to find out that was a DIFFERENT account for an earlier visit How did they end up precisely the same amount then She couldn't answer that The bills were for different types of services so what on earth Down to the cents value how likely is that So now instead of happily just paying it I have to every time go into my bill pay and set up the account number again And hope I really dust finish paying off the previous visit Why can't they use ONE ACCOUNT per person They're obviously associated with one person Most companies use invoice numbers to keep bills separate but all against the same account number Why why why do they make it harder for us to pay successfully It's cheaper for them not to have to try to chase the money down why not make it easier for us to pay so they don't have to chase it down They did suggest I put in the information on THEIR site No I don't give medical bill people permission to pull directly from my checking account thanks especially not if I'll end up having to put that information in per bill anyway Grr Ok thanks for letting me rant guys Companies that change account numbers aigh,ADHD

426,I've only ever tried adderall It didn't really work well for me It made me want to do everything simultaneously and I wasn't able to focus on one single task like I wanted So I'm thinking about asking my psychiatrist on Friday to see about trying a non-stimulant instead especially since my psychiatrist refuses to prescribe controlled substances unless I seek a fifth diagnosis of adhd I think it's ridiculous since I've already been officially diagnosed 4 times in the past 13 years Did the non-stimulant medication work better than the traditional stimulants Did non-stimulant adhd medications work for you,ADHD
427,Basically I went to get testing for ADHD and failed Despite fitting all the diagnostic criteria symptoms my psychologist won t diagnose me just because I failed two simple tests even though everyone in my family has ADHD and having a psychological report as a child saying I was highly likely to have it never got diagnosed as too young amp x200B First test is the TOVA test The psychologist left the room when I did it The thing is I was basically highly motivated at this point for anything that came my way as i ve been literally going crazy waiting two weeks for this appointment I also have a hyper interest in psychology mixed with an intense sense of competition So at this point the test was of GREAT interest to me as boring as it was As I did the test my eyes would constantly wander and my brain almost immediately started thinking its mirage of random racing thoughts I would constantly reposition myself and pick up in the tiniest noises from outside Even so I was determined to do well and easily made it through the whole test When she asked me how I did I made sure to mention my restlessness but she just chalked it down to anxiety even though I didn t have any for that test amp x200B Next day I came in and took a much funner test I forgot what it s called but it had me see changes in patterns I didn t know this was for ADHD I thought it was testing intelligence which is something i m highly sensitive about have been mistaken as autistic or unintelligent in the past by people and thus have an intense drive to prove that i m not as stupid as I come off to be The test was rather easy to me too and I was basically hyper fixated on doing well Turns out I did a little too well on these tests and both turned out negative for ADHD I was completely appalled especially considering how she lied and said the TOVA test tracked eye movement for concentration which if it did it would ve definitely shown up that my eyes were all over the place If I took those tests as a child I surely would ve tested positive Over the years i ve learned to mask really well too amp x200B TLDR Is it possible that certain factors can effect someone with ADHD s attention on tests I find it really odd that my failing of the tests was the sole reason I can t get diagnosed despite fitting everything else Can you have ADHD and do well on tests,ADHD

454,Hey everyone Hoping that there may be some tips suggestions for helping me with what seems like a simple problem but continues to dictate my daily routine For context I ve only recently been diagnosed with ADHD just over 6 months ago and have since been taking medication In terms of my general presentation I would say that 80 of the time my traits are a strength that tend to serve me well I have always been a super productive task oriented person and when I get an idea in my head I hyper-focus and must strike while the iron is hot This applies to any and all tasks important or not In terms of my prior studies and current work it means I am super organised timely and efficient and has allowed me to forge a successful career Unfortunately this also applies to my personal life and lately I ve been starting to feel as if it is getting out of control I have 2 boys 6 and 3 and a baby girl due in late Feb so as you can imagine life is pretty busy My wife has struggled physically a little more this pregnancy and in my efforts to try and take the load off it seems like I am in an endless cycle of trying to tick off jobs tasks with the rationale that if I do it now it means I won t have to later only later I find a dozen new things that MUST be done I do feel as though part of this is a learned behaviour We had kids quite young and have worked hard to set ourselves up so that we can enjoy a healthy happy life I ve always felt my work ethic and diligence is the wining formula so it feels odd to mess with it Currently I am on holidays and have spent the last two weeks pretty much doing odd jobs around the house including tasks like tidying cleaning gardening DIY etc Highlights include hanging curtains at 10pm and doing a minor lawn renovation out the front with a headlamp at 9pm in the dark because it seemed to be the best time to do it using the above rationale Essentially it feels like from the moment I wake to the moment my head hits the pillow at night it s 100 miles an hour every minute of the day I ve started to question whether this is A anxiety driven constantly doing things means I never challenge the idea that if I don t the world won t stop B some sort of sub-conscious self-fulfilling prophecy whereby having a diagnosis has become justification for this behaviour C a self-esteem issue being productive means I am useful and therefore not as easily disposable ps I have a great relationship with my loving supporting wife who is a dream partner mum to our children I know that my current cycle is not sustainable and although I do believe in setting high standards for oneself because to me low expectations has always low achievement I am constantly hit with feelings of guilt I spend time with my boys and we get up to lots of things particularly given my ability to work flexibly and have time off from work But I do find myself constantly saying in a minute soon etc as I find it difficult stopping something I have started but also not completing tasks I have set for myself mostly in my head My biggest fear is that I will one day look back and regret not being more present I know there will come a time where I along with my wife are no longer their entire world It feels like a double edged sword if I m not being productive I feel guilty genuinely can t relax ever But some nights I lay in bed and think why did I not stop x and play that game with the boys I never want my wife or kids to feel unimportant unheard or not a priority but I fear that my daily behaviours actions will eventually do exactly that Even though part of me still hangs on to the fact that all of these tasks are beneficial to those around me if I m being honest they are clearly more meaningful to me for reasons I am trying to figure out I m quite sure my family would prefer to have an extra 30 minutes 1 hour 3 hours whatever of sustained quality time with me than to have a tidy house 24 7 a shopping list written 3 days in advance not a single leaf in the pool dinner prepped 3 hours in advance when I still have to cook part of it at dinner time anyway the list goes on Sorry for the long post believe me I ve condensed it ha-ha Would love to get some insights from you all Productivity amp high standards will be my demise,ADHD

465,Hello everyone Just looking for some tips advice anything really So I got diagnosed 3 years ago and meds have really helped Was also diagnosed 5 years ago with anxiety which is also now under control So I noticed that thinking just thinking deeply in general critical thinking mulling over things has made me more and more exhausted especially recently It's to note that holidays are typically a stressful time for me and I'm sure that it contributed to the level of exhaustion I feel but the exhaustion itself is not out of the ordinary If I think back to when I was younger I feel like I enjoyed thinking more like I enjoyed puzzles games reading playing in general I was still quite energetic in college picked an academically challenging major struggled a bit but ultimately I am happy where I ended up But wow the exhaustion now I no longer enjoy my puzzles or games or reading because using my brain when I should be relaxing makes me tired Completing tasks and errands mostly thinking about them and worrying about putting them off consumes me I'm able to function at work but there's this feeling of fatigue and lack of sharpness that gnaws at me I feel like my brain has built up so much stimuli and I don't know how to let it all go I've tried exercise meditation grounding sleeping all to no avail Has anyone experienced this I'm aware this could be my anxiety compounding on my ADHD and I definitely feel hyper stimulated But my anxiety is definitely mostly under control no panic attacks and what I have then is this feeling that my brain is just always ON even if I'm not thinking about anything Instead of getting used to it it's wearing me down Any help or insight would be appreciated Built-up tiredness exhaustion makes thinking tiring,ADHD
466,I know im not allowed to ask this hut Where i live there aren t any therapists unless you go on a drive for 2 hours and i never had that time cuz of study and my parents dont believe in therapy so i never actually knew if i have it or not What made me think i have it is that what people with adhd have felt kinda relatable I cant imagine one thing and when i try to i repeat the same imagination again and again every time i try to stay on one image i either go back to the start or imagine something else after a short period of time Another thing is that i get distracted really easly i put work to last minute and always end up beeing late on a project or on a date When somone tells me their name it doesnt take long until i forget it i forget my study too when i go to the exam or when the teacher asks me a question even if i have studied it before i just cant remember mybe i can after 5 minutes or even an hour so Do i have ADHD or im i just stressed Im falling apart,ADHD
467,After over a year of postponing i finally went and had my first meeting with a therapist about my suspicions of having ADHD I'm 36 They diagnosed me with ADHD HIP advised me to get tested for both and have monthly check ups with a psychiatrist about it I have a couple of friend who've tested positive for ADHD and are in the process of getting prescribed the proper medicine and after discussing my recent diagnosis they told me therapists often diagnose their patient with both ADHD and HIP but HIP is rarely confirmed after being tested and i should prepare to be disapointed Any truth in it Also while discussing with my therapist they said it wasn't the norm to intelectualize everything and the way i was doing it through semi dissociation was exhausting Example I have an emotional reaction layer 1 I see myself having an emotional reaction layer 2 I analyze both layer 1 amp 2 and start wondering if my initial reaction is genuine or the result of trying to fit an expected reaction layer 3 I witness layer 3 understand there's an issue and try to understand what it is layer 4 I observe layer 4 and wonder if knowing there's an issue i'm not trying to better fit the clinical description of ADHD or else to reassure myself which would modify the reactions in Layers 1 2 and 3 Layer 5 This being said i'm not overwhelmed by it i'm used to it since i'm doing that constantly and they said intelectualizing so much helped me cope with some trauma that could have otherwise triggerd an anxiety disorder But that i must be exhausted Anyone with something similar Also since i'm about to set up the appointment with the psychatrist what should i expect from it Should i aim to be medicated people talking about how they didn't realize how normal people were makes me envious curious I know i want to work on myself but i'm kinda lost as to how and what i should aim for Recent Diagnosis and questions,ADHD

474,HI everyone I'm hoping someone can give me advice I'm a law student who regularly gets bogged down by the barrage of information in front of me every day This is especially the case in law school where I am almost never able to finish my readings or respond to questions in class that require me to process hypothetical scenarios Put simply I need a lot of time to process information and what seems like a manageable amount of information to the typical law student or person is actually a lot for my brain to handle I am good at analysis and comprehension I am also good at writing but I feel so incompetent in this field because i rarely finish readings or assignments on time due to the processing I cannot afford a neuropsych evaluation so I don't have the luxury of getting a diagnosis and clinical advice I'm wondering if anyone can give me some advice on how to still be successful in my career Law is very intense but I love it and am passionate about it However most employers don't want to hire someone who is going to slow down their firm when there are plenty of other law students who aren't hindered by processing difficulties Any advice on how to get faster Is there any hope I'm 30 and I'd like to believe that I can still change my brain or at least be a successful and effective lawyer despite processing so slowly It just always seems like I am incompetent to others because I am taking so long to process information or I am isolating myself because i get exhausted from environmental stimuli noise after a few minutes These are qualities that seem opposite to what legal employers are looking for Help HELP Desperate law student with SENSORY OVERLOAD THAT IS RUINING MY LIFE IN LAW SCHOOL,ADHD

491,My mind is a mess as I type this I feel like since my parents don't believe me no one else will I am 26f In 2020 I was introduced to the idea that I might have ADHD I remember looking into it going past the stereotypical bouncing off the walls and sobbing For the first time since I was old enough to have any form of self realization I felt seen Around the same time I started therapy up again for my anxiety anxiety OCD disorders diagnosed since age 9 I also wanted to speak to someone about how my mind and body felt disconnected I felt trapped I knew I had to do something or I WANTED to do something but I couldn't move a muscle I was frustrated because I couldn't be productive Tasks felt like they took a million years I felt like I was working so hard and so fast but was only getting half the work done I sat down on the first day to meet my new therapist and before I could even explain everything she asked if I had ADHD This was not the first time a medical professional had observed me and asked I broke down crying and we spoke about all of my other symptoms She referred me to a psychiatrist for medicine who did a screening and concluded that my results were very positive positive ADHD negative not ADHD This was not full testing however I went home and told my parents It explained SO MUCH Everything that I'd ever struggled with or got in trouble for I felt so light knowing that there wasn't just something wrong with me But my mom refused to believe it because she works in an elementary with kids so she knows what adhd looks like My dad doesn't believe too much in mental health They told me they didn't like my therapist I spent a few months trying to gently educate them see It makes sense now and I was ignored Finally last month I asked my mom if she paid attention to any of the stuff I sent her She then told me that she doesn't believe I have ADHD I just lack the will to do things I felt so betrayed I want to get formal testing done so I can show them But as dumb as this sounds what if I somehow mess the testing up and my results are normal I've been so happy since my diagnosis because I feel comfort in knowing that it's not just me who is like this But if it's not ADHD then I don't know what I'm going to do My Parents Don't Believe I Have ADHD They Say I Just Lack the Will,ADHD
492,I ve been on ADHD meds almost my whole life The longest one I was on was Concerta Back in 2020 I decided to try medication again after having been off it for like 5 or so years because my symptoms got pretty bad Doc and I decided on Vyvanse because I also have a huge issue with compulsive overeating and binge eating Instantly I noticed the difference when I started Vyvanse Pre-Vyvanse I weighed like 175 and overall I lost about 25lbs And when I was taking it it s not like I was eating healthier in fact I was probably eating a lot worse just in less portions Plus my symptoms were actually quite manageable and I could get out of bed a lot easier in the morning which is huge for me I stopped taking it because there was a mishap with my doctor health insurance and I had to stop cold turkey So I ve been off of it for about 5 months now I ve already gained almost all of the weight back I feel awful My health insurance was figured out and I want to go back on it but the biggest reason I want to is to lose weight again and I don t think that s a healthy reason to want to take that kind of medication Really I m just unsure of what to do My doctor said we can wait a little bit and I can think on it but I still honestly don t know what to do I like Vyvanse and how it helped my ADHD symptoms and my ED I m just worried that I ll never be able to lose weight organically Looking for input on those with similar experiences with Vyvanse or another medication Recently stopped taking Vyvanse,ADHD

521,This bag has been a life changer for me I love it for many reasons 1 Its very had to loose I struggle with forgetfulness and object permanence Countless times I've forgotten my bag after I hung it up at someones house or left it on a chair in a restaurant But this one is really small and compact and you can wear it cross body The material is light and soft so ypu dont have to take it off If I'm outside of the house I just never take it off Bonus points if you get it in a bright color like I got it in a hot pink So if I get used to seeing the bright hot pink in my vision field across my body And if its not there it raises alarms for me Mind you Im the type of person who when I was a kid I would literally alk out of school and forget my backpack Only to realize I forgot it when I got home I even did this in college 2 It packs a lot for how small it is All my essentials Its easy to grab stuff from like when youre checking out for example 3 The way it wears on your body is just so much more comfortable than a traditional womens purse Like my hands are free with this thing and I can have it be at the front of my body rather than like on the side of my torso under my arm and armpit This is silly but I really hate the unsymmetrical feeling of having a bag on one side of my body and like it can be uncomfortable having my arm rest over a bulky bag 4 Finally it's fashionable and socially acceptable where I live So many women wear it so I don't feel like I stand out in any way Its one of those cases where brands unintentionally make a super accessible and cute product for us even though they didn't have us in mind when they were designing the product Lululemon belt bags,ADHD

533,amp x200B Hi All My psychologist recommended an ADHD assessment with another psychologist who specializes in ADHD Based on our discussions he suspects I might have ADHD The new psychologist also seemed sure about it and mentioned she believes I have ADHD but she needed to conduct the DIVA test before referring me to a psychiatrist I was completely honest during the assessment I first started to notice symptoms about 15 years ago at university and it feels like they have been worsening year by year In my youth I don t recall experiencing focus issues or perhaps I wasn t aware of them In most sections of the DIVA test I indicated no symptoms in childhood but I have most symptoms in adulthood except the hyperactive part At the end of the test the psychologist stated that ADHD cannot just appear in adulthood and I was not diagnosed with ADHD I'm unsure how to feel about this While I don't claim to know more than a professional I have read multiple studies suggesting that ADHD can develop in adulthood though I may have misunderstood What do you think about the possibility of ADHD occurring in adulthood I'm curious to hear others perspectives or experiences regarding this P S I've never taken drugs and had normal alcohol consumption social drinking during weekends during my late teenage years Navigating ADHD Diagnosis in Adulthood,ADHD

553,I'm 37 and late last year I was diagnosed with ADHD I also have bipolar type 2 which is why it took so long to diagnose At first I was so relieved that there was an answer to why I was having so much trouble focusing and my meds Vyvanse immediately started helping But within a couple weeks it stopped helping Doctor upped the dose It started working again then I was swapped to the generic and it stopped Doctor upped the dose again on the generic It's better than nothing but I still can't focus enough to work I'm an indie author My Patreon is a huge part of helping me stay afloat every month plus I need to get a book out this Spring There's so much riding on me being able to work but I can't seem to focus on anything important I know that it takes time to get meds right but I can't help but feel like it's somehow my fault Like I'm asking too much of medication to fix me and really I'm just not trying hard enough When the meds worked I was writing constantly and it was amazing Now it's like I'm fighting for every word I'm scared that I'll be constantly chasing meds that work briefly before I'm back to where I started What if I'm beyond help and I'm stuck feeling this way forever Frustrated that my meds aren't working as well as they used to,ADHD

557,Hello Everyone I ve just recently joined this subreddit because I ve never been able to assure myself that I infact have ADHD Despite my diagnosis you constantly hear that Oh Everybody has ADHD etc plus just the general stigma against ADHD medicine However I ve been able to relate to a lot of the individuals here since I ve joined and I wanted to use this post to put one of my most detrimental shortcomings and see if you guys can relate The inability to start anything that is not explicitly laid out for me Be it an essay an assignment an email it s so extremely hard for me to get it started This is pretty common for a lot of people with ADHD But these things I usually let pile up until they re needed to be done That s when I take my medication and spend 8-12 hours getting it all done However what I feel like is far more limiting is completing things I want to that aren t explicitly outlined on how they are to be done For example I got my real estate license about a year ago Getting the license was the exact same process as mentioned wait til the day before the exam pop a vyvanse and study my ass off But now I want to begin doing the rest prospecting networking social media etc But it has been so difficult for me to even create the plan or make strides towards beginning my career This amongst other life goals that I have been unable to work towards has really impacted my mental health negatively and I m currently in a place where I hate myself for it Total pessimist nowadays The goal moving forward is to create my plan take my medication to help me act upon it and try and get myself out of this rut I appreciate any advice although I have a hard time receiving advice for some reason Also if anyone can help me feel better about taking my medication regularly as the whole Adderall is a bad drug thing has been stopping me from taking it I d appreciate that as well Cheers and a happy new year to you all I really fucking hope this year we can all get our shit together because this recent year for me has been pretty grim Do you guys relate,ADHD

567,Sorry if I break any rules new to the sub I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD primarily the inattentive type shedding light on why I'm grappling with my computer science degree The onslaught of projects big and small has been overwhelming and I'm facing a debilitating reaction to emails messages and notifications related to my classes The panic and nausea make it difficult to attend classes or participate in quizzes I'm desperately seeking answers to understand what's happening to me The situation has escalated to the point where I contemplated taking a mid-semester break only to discover it's against university guidelines I'm now torn between continuing to attend classes inevitably failing this semester and shattering my remaining sanity or skipping classes and still facing failure resulting in expulsion due to my already low CGPA The stress reached a peak when my professor despite being informed and provided proof of my antidepressant medication threatened to bar me from the final exam due to attendance issues The pressure became so unbearable that I attempted suicide twice narrowly escaping both times Now I find myself confined to my room grappling with the shame of failing and struggling to communicate with my concerned mother Struggling with ADHD in University,ADHD
568,Hi all I was diagnosed over a year ago and the more I learn about ADHD the more I feel like my symptoms are destroying my life For as long as I can remember I have been going through cycles of getting interested in getting good at something pursuing it rabidly then getting discouraged and switching onto something else I called this my flip-flopping before I was diagnosed and learned that it's extremely common I do this for both work-related things and for hobby-level things In both cases this is exhausting and since I'm about to turn 32 the existential dread is sinking in and it is depressing to be the jack-of-all-trades Right now I'm trying for the n th time to get into drawing My therapist has suggested many times that I need to grieve the notion of being an expert at things but that is difficult when A my job livelihood requires me to be an expert and B I so desperately want to be good at something One of my big blind spots is that when struggling with anything e g learning to shade with a pencil I start thinking I'm getting old and this is not worth it I should be spending my time doing something that will actually help me such as X and that makes me feel panicky and I flip-flop onto something else for a few days or even up to a week A decade plus of doing this has me exhausted and frustrated and feeling a little hopeless Can anyone relate to getting through this Specifically how can one attempt to avoid giving up on something they want to do because these existential thoughts creep in How to not give up existential despair,ADHD

571,Hey there fellow deficits I was struggling with focusing on a more complicated task for my job when I decided to lookup tips for how to focus in these scenarios where it feels impossible for my brain One tip I read was gameifying certain tasks which I thought was a great idea That made me think about how much I say that I want to cook more but a I know so little about cooking that it becomes daunting and b I get no dopamine and so I go get fast food again which I honestly hate doing So it made me wonder is there possibly an app out there that essentially gameifies cooking Like teaching recipes and just making the experience a game overall or something to that effect Almost like a duolingo for cooking I thought if anyone knew about something like that it would be you guys Thanks Looking for a Cooking Game App,ADHD

577,Hey everyone I wanted to share something that might hopefully help others that are going through the same thing as I am today I'm overwhelmed New Years has always been this weird thing for me I'm both excited and optimistic about all of the new possibilities for the year It has this energy to it where change is possible and I can make it happen But because I have ADHD all of these possibilities are overwhelming and daunting I can't tell you how many times I've made goals and resolutions and almost instantly abandoned them only to fall into the same habits through the year that burn me out or prevent me from making any progress in things I had hoped So I'm taking a different approach this year Maybe this is something that can help you if you're struggling like me I'm applying some principles from my line of work to help me think of goals that are easy for me to prototype in small bites and then gradually grow them if they are enjoyable for me Here's how I'm approaching it 1 Do the smallest thing first Don't be tempted to make huge sweeping changes all at once and expect to be successful Break things down into small tiny things that are easier to incorporate into your daily life For example if you're not currently going to the gym don't set a goal that you're going to start going to the gym 5 days a week Instead try to prototype it by only committing the easiest chunk you can reliably do like maybe just going to the gym once or twice a week Or cut the gym entirely take a walk for 20 minutes 3 days a week Even better say you'll take a walk for 20 minutes 3 days a week for only 1 month That's way more achievable than trying to commit to a full year of a new habit right And once you get to that 1 month you can decide to keep going for another month or if you really don't like it you can switch to something else But at least you did the 1 month A win The goal being what is the smallest piece you can do with the least amount of friction and change all at once 2 Allow yourself room to screw up As a recovering perfectionist I have a natural tendency to think if I set a goal and then don't stick to that goal perfectly I'm a fuck up Don't be like me Building on the previous example let's say your smallest bite for exercise is taking a 20 minute walk 3 times a week Allow yourself some weeks where you get 2 walks in Maybe some days where you're tired from work you say your minimum is 5 minutes instead of 20 See if you can avoid zero walks by changing the parameters Don't let black and white thinking make it seem like you either achieve perfectly or do nothing at all allow yourself the flexibility 3 Rule of threes Don't overcommit to a ton of different things pick three I know for my ADHD brain I can easily generate hundreds of different ideas and things I want to do A year is a LONG time to me Surely I can switch careers master a new instrument train for a marathon and and and etc No Time blindness right Don't be tempted Three things Three You have to prioritize Force yourself to pick three things to prototype for the year similar to my exercise example Pick the smallest piece you can try for your goals and set easily achievable steps instead of wanting to take on the entire world Use time boxing to set limits Don't commit to a full year of any one thing but maybe just 1-3 months of 3 new things And then re-evaluate at that time But only commit to three small things max So for me my goals are looking like this so far 1 I want to see my friends more Set an automated reminder to have a group lunch or dinner with my core friends once a month for 6 months 2 Write more music Set aside 1 hour twice a week for 3 months to sit down and write a few seconds of music A new riff or chord progression Anything 3 I need more exercise I'm going to try the gym twice a week for January after work for one hour each I'm going to buy a gym bag to make going directly from the office easier to lessen the friction I'm not claiming this will work for everyone I'm experimenting with this for myself but wanted to share in case anyone else finds it useful or helpful We'll see what happens What are some things y'all are doing to set resolutions or goals for 2024 New Years is kind of overwhelming for perfectionists with ADHD like me Trying something new instead,ADHD
578,Hi everyone this will be my first ever post and just in time for the New Year So I thought I would share with you all my new motto in life to keep myself better organized and focussed on the more meaningful things in my life I call them the 6 RE s They are 1 REFRESH Do something to refresh your mind like washing your face taking a shower some light meditation going for a walk outside or talking to someone you haven t in a while 2 RECHARGE Get sustenance Eat something healthy drink water do a little exercise to get that blood bumping Your brain will thank you Also do something simple to make yourself feel happy listen to music watch something funny cute etc But don t do this for too long 3 REWIND Now that you feel fresh again look at your actions the past day week even month if need be How productive were they Are you happy with where you are at or not 4 RETHINK If you re doing good great Keep going and maybe even improve where you can If not that s ok What you need to do now is reframe your mind and tell yourself what are the things you NEED to do now to be in control of your life again Don t overthink it just make a note list whatever and 5 REFOCUS Now focus on doing the right things that you know will be rewarding for yourself once completed 6 REMIND Repetition is the key to success Constantly remind yourself of the 6 Re s Set a phone reminder sticky notes have a friend tell you whatever works best for you Hopefully at least some of you might find these tips helpful in whatever endeavors you intend to follow These could be school a career social life dating family life or even just day to day life Just keep on pushing through never give up and remember You got this my fellow ADHDers A Strategy to Stay Focussed and Motivated,ADHD

585,I m 18 and live with my parents I don t think I d make it if I didn t and they have certain rules I need to abide by in order to stay I m assigned to a room and I m expected to clean it every weekday at 7pm The thing I really dread is Sundays which are deep clean days Deep cleans take hours to do and a lot of steps that I must get done near immaculately I always feel stuck or frozen when doing them and get constantly distracted so rather than it taking 2 hours like how they can do it it takes 5 or 6 hours to not even be completely finished My parents are aware I have ADHD I was diagnosed at 17 but they never walked me through how to treat it or what I should do to help regulate symptoms So I always tend to disappoint them and get in trouble for not getting chores done or acceptable I ve tried explaining to them how chores are especially difficult to get done but it usually gets chalked up to an excuse and that I m just being lazy and not a team player for the household Whenever I get fussed at for hours and hours and hours on why I just can t do my job like everyone else I cry from the rejection and get called a victim because I was supposed to ask for help if I m struggling But I m too scared to ask for it They think crying is a manipulation tactic so that I can continue avoiding work I don t know what to do they ve told me that they sometimes consider kicking me out of the house because I can t do an easy task as cleaning the house But they don t understand that I can t actually do my job the way they want me to I feel lazy and incompetent and I just want to not disappoint them more I ve tried lists and alarms and planners but nothing has worked I just want to feel understood and maybe have some advice on how to maneuver this because I m running out of ideas I don t know how to not disappoint my parents,ADHD

588,Hi I've been recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd and a bit later also a acquaintance of mine has We bonded a lot and became friends very quickly but it never became something romantic at least for me or physical but we always shared a lot to each other since we felt both safe and enjoyed chatting a lot Obviously this has brought the attention of my partner and I tried to explain that probably because of the adhd I had different friendship that were pretty much a dopamine rush for a while and then stabilised as more normal friendship never something more Am I the only one Friendship hyperfixation,ADHD
589,I apologize in advance if some of the things I am saying are confusing sometimes I think faster than I type My daughter 6F was diagnosed with ADHD a couple of months ago by her doctor I honestly felt bad for not seeing it sooner because I always thought it was just normal behavior for her age But then her reading scores were pretty low and when we do any type of reading at home or workbook it takes her 5x longer than her brother to finish We then went to her doctor with that concern and she had us fill out a questionnaire for her And while filling out the questionnaire I went down a rabbit hole for myself She is now on meds and it has helped greatly We only have her on it during school days I started looking at myself as a whole I don't remember much about what I was like as a child I just know that I did pretty good in school it was around high school that I was started slacking in school work but still did average I know that there were a couple of comments from my teachers in elementary school that I talked a lot and very social But that has changed as well I am much more introverted now There are my daily symptoms that I think might be concerning But then again it might just be normal I have a hard time sleeping most since I can't team to turn off my brain I am always thinking about what is needed to be done next And so once I have gone over that and still can't sleep I create little stories in my head until I fall asleep Sometimes I will think about things that happens years ago and think about what I should have done differently or how embarrassing it was I talk to myself a lot Didn't think this was abnormal until I got into high school I don't see other people doing it that much I will straight up have conversations with myself in the car Sometimes I prepare conversations for myself when I know I am about to approach someone I get distracted easily If I go into a store I will be heading towards one section but thinking about another section Or I am holding something my eyes will already moved on to something new I ramble and then forget what I was even talking about I love to read but cannot stay still to read long enough I look forward to finishing a chapter to get up and do something else and then come back I tend to interrupt people without thinking like finishing their sentence or answering the questions before it's finish I don't do this with everyone if I focus really hard I can stop it I get sensory overload easily if there are too much noise I can't focus and get frustrated So that also goes with short temper I am pretty impatient I keep it to myself but I am yelling at myself in my head most of the time I do have an appointment with my doctor this Wednesday so hoping to see what they say I do know I might have a bit of an anxiety problem as well so that might just be it I never really thought about ADHD until my daughter was diagnosed and I started reading more about it I guess I am just trying to see if this just normal behaviors among people who have actually been diagnosed amp x200B Daughter was diagnosed with ADHD couple months ago and it's making me look at myself,ADHD

593,23 m recently learned about through YouTube ted talk on it and it suddenly felt so similar to my life and I watched some more video and post and immediately concluded I have adhd because not only many symptoms align but also my life was and is still a mess and it was easier for me to blame it on adhd But with time I just started wasting my time watching adhd content on YouTube wasting my time but not doing anything about it I just felt that oh it's also responsibile for ruining my life although I don't discarded my personal mistakes but I grew complacent about them However I slowly realised despite many symptoms fell perfectly many were just not and sounded like a normal person who is addocted to digital device which eventually led to realisation of how I am just wasting my time with it doing nothing and being a loser Although I avoid watching adhd content for above reasons but the thought still keeps coming back as it explained lots of stuff which I or anyone was never able to understand And my broke ass can't afford to get myself professionally diagnosed despite many people talking about it Can anyone help me what should I do to get out of this loop I feel like I have adhd but I am not sure and can't get professionally diagnosed due to financial reason and this doubt is making things even worse What should I do,ADHD

599,I m so sorry everyone this is like a huge life dump this is gonna be a long one So I m in my last year of college going into my last semester and have recently gotten a new prescription for anti depressants that may work better than my previous medication But since last year at my apartments without a chore chart or a plan with the housemates I find I m unable to get myself to clean spaces I don t use I m in art school and my commute is about a 2 hour transit and my work is in the same area as my school and so I m out for most of the week at either work or school Typically I would come back to my apartment during the week for around 10pm and I would have an off day on Wednesdays this last semester I always clean up after myself but I don t clean common spaces since I m out so frequently my mind can t wrap my head around why I should have to I m gonna ask my roommates about a chore chart today because I want to help around the apartment but I feel so directionless without something like that and when I come home the first thing on my mind is to get my work done because there are only so many hours in the day to do that when I m not at school I devote most of my time to my homework animated projects take a lot of time to produce and if not that I try to get sleep in and I find myself exhausted and demoralized chronically My old roommates were still able to clean despite this and my current roommates one of them work over full time and still cleans I think In my mind something always has to give for me to be able to do it all so in my living space I tend to clean up after myself and never leave a mess and take the trash out when I get home but it s really hard for me to get myself to do anymore than that We ended up getting mice that are coming in through my closet and we re drawn to some packaged food I had and random stuff I brought over from my previous apartment and I ended up throwing out a ton of stuff and am taking home parents house almost all my things But finding them all over my stuff and one dead in one of my boxes felt like a breaking point where I feel all this pressure coming down on me where I m already not happy in my living situation due to the distance from school when my whole goal is just to finish school so I can go home before I move in with one of my best friends from home My schedule is up in the air and I feel like I can t plan for things the way I would like to I ve been also recovering by a really intense burnout that has taken over a year to really start feeling my feelings again and my monitor hasn t been displaying so I ve been half living at school and half living at my partners place to get work on my thesis done I feel like I m constantly walking on eggshells with my current apartment and it s getting to that point where I feel like something needs to give I can t tell if I m making excuses for not doing more but I feel like I also have been doing the best I can with the state I am in Last night I found a dead mouse in my things and lost it a bit and my parents are coming to get me for a few days to figure out what I should do I feel like my thoughts are very chaotic and as someone who likes to plan ahead and have things in a rigid routine I feel like I can t think any one thought clearly and feel like I am being pulled in so many directions and I feel such constant anxiety that I don t really feel quite able to function I really don t know what I should do or what the right thing is I ve been offered a room at a friends apartment that s very close to school and that option feels like it s too good to be true My parents think I should move closer to school in February or march to give me a stable living environment where I can be in a living space more frequently and would have access to things I need to feel safe and comfortable and able to function such as room to stim etc my partner and one of my close friends think I should stick out my time at this apartment and reconcile with my roommates and implement a chore chart so that once a week I d have a space in the apartment to clean and that would maybe make the environment easier to live in emotionally since my roommates have been kind of passive aggressive with me lately for being gone while the mice are still in the apartment and I had been gone for almost a month during finals season where I was just kind of living at school during 24 hour access The mice were centralized in my room so I naively thought cleaning the stuff out of my room would deter them since the entry points are in my room id started sleeping in my computer chair the past three months since the mice got in my blankets and on my bed so I just started moving all my things onto my bed since the room is so small and I need to create more open spaces and get everything off the floor but somehow they re in the kitchen and living area and my roommates have singled me out as the sole reason for the mice despite it being winter in Boston I feel so ashamed for the mice being here and I may not know my roommates very well but I feel so bad and I m taking almost everything out from my room and sealing every possible hole If the entry points are in my room they should be keeping the mice out if sealed I m going to fix the problem with the mice and I have to have a conversation about it today with my roommates You know when everything just feels like so much If the mouse situation wasn t occurring I d still be just numbly dissatisfied if that makes sense I can t tell if I need to see this through until I graduate in June or if this deep series of complex emotions I ve been feeling since moving in are trying to tell me something about my living situation or trying to tell me that I m just not happy I left my old apartment because I was angry and didn t want to talk to my roommates this time I just feel overwhelmed and isolated because that s what I thought I wanted at the time Everyone has a different opinion and I think I feel so scrambled I don t really know what I think about the situation I just see the idea of moving right next to school as the holy grail id been searching for But to do that requires a lot of planning and technicalities that I don t even want to think about at the moment and I wouldn t be out until February or March if I can find someone to replace me in that time I feel very exhausted I burned out after working full time during school and I think In a way I feel like I m still picking up the pieces Am I running away Or am I trying to get into something better I really don t know My parents said to take it one step at a time I m sorry I don t know if this is selfish but I really want to go home If you read through this I really appreciate you and I thank you for holding space for my chaotic thinking I Feel I Only Have The Capacity to do the Bare Minimum,ADHD

608,Someone asked me what my biggest takeaway from 2023 was and this is the first thing that popped into my head You know how at the beginning of a year you make a resolution And then like a few days later you skip a day or miss a day or not as motivated but it's just that ONE day Like you forgot to pack the healthy lunch before you left on your 1 hr commute to work or a kid has to go to the orthodontist or pediatrician so you can't go to the gym that day so you promise to start over next week But then inevitably something pops up and life happens your kid breaks an arm or ankle and now you're trying to fit in orthopedist appointments on top of soccer games and drum lessons and keeping the house clean or your other kid is in trouble with school and that's serious so he must need more supervision and parenting and attention right now and oh yeah you're neglecting your relationship and or SO and now he doesn't feel like he's a priority so this must not being your main thing to rectify but you haven't gone in for your annual physical or annual Pap smear in over 3 years and now you need to schedule therapy for yourself but therapists only meet during the hours you work or online where you don't feel comfortable being open and vulnerable to a stranger that's not physically there kinda defeating the point of therapy and heaven forbid you neglect your job because how else will you pay the mortgage or the house cleaner that this sub convinced you to get and it's been life-changing and you can never ever go back to not having a biweekly house cleaner not matter how expensive because you not only don't know how you ever kept the house even somewhat tidy before but also because you really don't have the time to clean when you can't even go to the gym one day a week and if you bring this up your SO points out that you spend almost an hour each evening on your iPad scrolling and not talking to people because apparently that's being lazy and not recharging or decompressing even though getting through a single day is 10x harder for you than anyone else because of your ADHD generalized anxiety disorder chronic depression PCOS allergies and rhinitis but oh wait those are all invisible so apparently people just brush them off and say they're sick of you using them as an excuse for why things never change you know how that happens So you promise yourself that next month you'll make the changes and you'll actually do the thing s and nothing will stop you starting then and you meant it SO much and could swear on every dead ancestor or every beloved object you have because you truly deeply honestly WANT to and have every intention of doing so And then the same cycle repeats 2023 taught me I can spend an entire year that way My Takeaway from 2023,ADHD

622,I am fully aware that this sub does not allow you to ask for medical diagnosis I want to clarify that this is not what I am asking for If this post still does not follow the r adhd rules I'm very sorry Let it be known that I tried I was assessed for ADHD at age 10 with a self-assessed quiz This convinced my mother a primary teacher that I do not have it Self-report studies https www verywellmind com definition-of-self-report-425267 have been proven to be commonly inaccurate as we cannot consistently and accurately judge ourselves I have had my secondary school run a teacher-assessed form which came back with no resounding traits However as a 15F I still want to pursue further diagnosis even if not ADHD just anything to explain my consistent struggles as I genuinely feel I have many ADHD traits that are inexplicable by mental disorders due to being in counselling having not alleviated any of my symptoms How can I explain to my mother that I want to see a GP about my traits without her invalidating my experiences She is firm in her belief that I do not have it yet I genuinely feel that I should at least try to pursue diagnosis Lost Mother is adamant that I do not have ADHD,ADHD
623,I hate hearing those two phrases because they represent one of my greatest failures I don t know what it is like for others with ADHD ADD but for me it s just impossible Whenever I have tried to focus on self improvement I always get distracted derailed or just defeated with in a week Even though I m medicated now it s still extremely har be even semi consistent with trying to improve myself I bristle with I hear work on yourself focus on self improvement,ADHD
624,Sometimes my partner who has adhd will insist that she audibly responded to a question but she is definitely mistaken She is silent I ve been lucky enough to experience instances of this when I visibly can see her face mouth she doesn t respond but insists she did She gets very worked up about this The only possible thing I can think of is that she THINKS she responded like in her mind she s saying yes or no but fails to actually say it out loud Anyone else with ADHD experience this Is there a clinical name for this Want to support her the best I can And don t just tell me not to worry about it or learn about it That perspective is significantly toxic The more we learn about each other the better She has taken the time to learn about my struggle with OCD so I will take the time to learn about her ADHD and we continue to support each other This also gives me insight for our child who will be here in April I want to be able to support their connection and communication as they grow Auditory Dialogue Phenomenon that is very hard to describe Please help,ADHD
625,Is that a typical ADHD trait There are things that I need to work on that are not really my hobby and I can do them and I can get myself to do it as well but I can only do it for a certain period of time and then I just can't stand working on it For example I needed to study on one special subject to get a certification and after a few days of studying it I just could not stand studying the subject anymore It was not hard to do or anything like that it was just that I just could only study it for an hour and then that was it I NEEDED to do something else even tho I still had energy to study more Annoyed from working on ONE task for a longer period of time,ADHD

627,Hi F20 been struggling with my mental health throughout my whole life and have recently asked my GP for an ADHD and ASD assessment which I m currently on the waiting list for Ever since I got out of my toxic abusive relationship a year and a half ago I find myself getting very intense hyperfixations for the first time in my life I ve always had intense interests in pop culture media certain shows celebrities but never like this I think it s my brain s way to cope with life since I have nothing else going on and am severely depressed I ve had 3 intense ones so far one related to a video game and 2 related to tv shows but they re mostly about the fictional characters I love and relate to I find myself spending hours watching edits looking at memes reading whole Reddit threads at 5 am thinking about them first thing in the morning and last thing before bed wanting to dream about them mentioning and talking about them wanting to make edits of them wanting to rewatch the content using them as a wallpaper or pfp etc It feels like a drug It just hits the spot I also feel very strongly for these and get physical reactions during the first stages of the hyperfixation I mostly consume depressing media that I can relate to so I feel sad and anxious for the fictional characters It s very consuming and the intensity comes and goes until one day I stop caring and I move on It sucks because when I like stuff I make it my entire personality for a while and never know how long it ll last When it ends I feel empty and want to turn back time so I can enjoy it for the first time again I feel obsessed and crazy at times Is this really what a hyperfixation is like Is this related to ADHD and possibly ASD Do NT s experience this Intense hyperfixations,ADHD

632,For those of you who have used telehealth to acquire a prescription do you know or have you transferred that prescription to a PCP Is that possible How viable is it I have an appointment with a telehealth doctor with whom I spoke on the phone about ADHD medication it seems promising but the initial appointment costs 200 and every month a follow-up appointment is required costing 150 Ideally I'd get the prescription from the initial appointment and then transfer it to my current PCP so they could fill it instead of having to pay 150 monthly to the telehealth doctor P S The telehealth provider is through ZocDoc feel free to share opinions on them Transfer Telehealth Prescription to PCP,ADHD
633,This whole scenario in my head is so fucked so I barely know how to describe it Also sorry if this isn't the right sub I really don't know where else to talk about this I went on a date with this girl in early 2022 She is absolutely gorgeous A beautiful woman and even more beautiful soul That being said it was the most traumatic and embarrassing date of my life also being the first date of my life The date was on whim she invited me to go roller skating bc one of her friends had canceled on her and i was getting off work so i decided to go She was very forward about everything she made all the moves I'm a very introverted and shy person so that attention was very unusual at the time We ended up going to a Mexican restaurant before skating When we got there the environment was very hectic and my anxiety was already pretty high For some dumb reason I thought having an energy drink before going was a good idea but in turn it only made me more anxious A lot of the time I'm not sure the rules of conversation or social scenarios so finding conversation was very hard and my brain was constantly screaming think of something to say think of something to say so most of the time at the table was spent in silence When we did talk it was about movies we both liked because we first had bonded over our shared love for niche horror films Which was great but also my demise A little context before I go further I was raised homeschooled in a very religious family So I equate my social deficits to that and my ADHD which at the time I didn't know about She also hadn't known I was homeschooled before we went out Onto the bad part She asked if I had seen the movie We Need to Talk About Kevin slight spoilers ahead for the movie because we were on the topic of films that made us uncomfortable For some reason my response to this was Yes I loved that one I've seen more films about school shootings than I've ever been in a school And as soon as those words left my lips I realized what I had just said and felt so ashamed I could tell I made her very uncomfortable And I shrank She asked what do you mean And my response was oh yeah I was homeschooled and we sat in silence for a little minute I was humiliated But my humiliation is nothing conpared to the discomfort I caused her I felt terrible for putting her in that situation She was very polite about it but I knew that there was no coming back from that After that she paid for the food and we still went skating But mentally I wasn't there anymore I went into a state of critical shame There's some more embarrassing stuff that happened at the skating rink but none of it compares to that Edit oh also at the time I hadn't known it was a date I just thought we were hanging out Also on the walk to the restaurant she had picked up a paper flower which was stuck in the snow gave it to me and said this is for you I just remembered this and think it's a very beautiful memory It had been overshadowed what I said ________________________ Now since that time we still occasionally talked we actually went out one other time which we planned before the first date but the week leading up to it we didn't really talk much We still have each other on social media And since that point we have interacted a few times She plays banjo and I love seeing her post videos of the songs she writes And she'll post comments under posts about my art or short films sometimes But other than that we don't talk We only see each other in passing through Instagram So now I can't explain why I can't get her out of my head I'll go months without realizing I'm thinking about her but she's still there I've been in a couple relationships since that point and even still I have thought of her while in those which has made me feel guilty Ironically her favorite movie is Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind Which if you don't know is about the idea of erasing someone from your memory And even though you erase them you still can't erase the connection you had with them That used to be one of my favorites too I love Charlie Kaufman and adore his writing But I can't watch it anymore without thinking of her and then becoming embarrassed about thinking of her and thinking if she's thinking if me then becoming embarrassed by that thought and thinking she's not thinking of me then thinking of what I said and so on I'm staying at a friend's house rn and he has a banner from the film Everytime I look at it I'm brought back to that moment And everytime i look at it I feel a little sad I guess thats what sparked this post I'm sorry if any of this is incoherent or if I'm just rambling But I'm seriously concerned on why she's in my head still Is it trauma Is it something else I don't know but she still appears in my dreams I don't want to fictionalize her either I don't want her to be this figure in my head of mysterious what ifs or what could bes or have expectations about who she is from that brief time we spent I just want to let her be Has this happened to anyone else Do you have people you don't even know who still appear in your dreams or in your thoughts Is there a phantom or a ghost of an idea of someone Is that an ADHD thing Is it something else I know these are not answers I'll probably find here But I need to talk about this because I haven't spoke a word of it to anyone I keep thinking about someone I don't really know,ADHD
634,I'm 19 I was diagnosed with autism at a young age and also had various other mental health issues which blended into each other and made it hard diagnose anything I've considered having ADHD in the past a lot of friends have asked me I could relate to a lot of symptoms most notably difficulty focusing on anything and extreme burnout productivity cycle But I blocked out and avoided looking for more information or talking to anyone I spent a long time trying to work on the issues I had so many different solutions that never worked Knowing that taking a pill could be the answer I spent so long trying to find hurts a lot I'm glad things are likely to get better but I feel like I've wasted so much of my life for no reason I want that time back I regret not realizing until adulthood,ADHD
635,How is everyone coping with the holidays Generally I'm not a huge fan of Christmas New Year holidays and will have a meltdown part way through This year seems particularly bad though and I'm wondering if taking a medication break is contributing to it My meds help my serotonin levels but I've been off them 10 days now The depression came on heavy overnight 4 days ago and its crushing Anyone else in the same position when they take a holiday Med holiday and General mood,ADHD

644,I ve had a major surgery that resulted in me being absent from college I have a sick leave for a month I don t have any excuse to ask for more as I m healing well I have only a week left I did nothing so far to catch up Not a single lecture recording watched not a line of code written I also missed all my online classes as on those days I had doctor appointments At first it was understandable as I was bed bound but for over a week I ve been well enough to just sit at my desk and watch lectures or do homework But instead I was just playing video games at night and sleeping during the day to avoid my family and responsibilities The material is already hard for me The most important subjects are the hardest for me as always the ones that matter the least go really well for me and I won t understand a thing if I come back to college without catching up with everything I missed I have a large project to do for one of the classes and I haven t even started I m honestly inclined to just trying to calculate if I ll pass without doing the project especially that I don t care about that class that much and my grades have been good so far I know I missed at least one exam I still don t know enough to pass it and I ll probably have to write it as soon as I get back I have so much programming to do So many hours of lecture recordings to watch So many subjects that I will have to try to understand based on just powerpoint presentations as some professors don t record I have no idea what I will do with math I m already failing it and I barely understand when someone teaches it to me how the fuck will I study on my own I even signed up for additional classes on math but I went to only one before disregarding them completely because they are late and I m too tired to do math for 90 minutes at 8 pm I thought that maybe I ll do something today I even took concerta but I m too sleep deprived to think and I also caught something as I m feeling nauseous and coughing a lot Or maybe it s my mind playing tricks on me because I don t want to do all that work I ve had a break from school I have to come back in a week and I still haven t caught up with material and homework,ADHD
645,I know this term is used especially in autism but lately i came to a conclusion about myself my social life and how i like to spend my time The thing is it feels like i had a thousand lives cause i m so good at shaping myself to other people that s why i ve been in too many different kind of groups of people in the past I m not good at relationships and it s not only the getting bored thing but the fact that people doesn t even try to accept the way i am like i do with them I know we are not obligated to accept the things we don t like in others but you know the kind of effort everyone does in relationships like YOU accept this and i accept this about yourself and then we will work in this through the time I m not here to say this is all people s fault cause i am so self conscious about the things i do wrong for people who sees relationships different but i am so tired of pretend and apologize when i don t answer texts for days or for not showing up at meetings this is how i am and i realized i don t want to change for anyone I m not saying i can t be friend with people who are not like me but i m so frustrated with the kind of friend that KNOWS YOU and tells you it s okay and they understand but then they show their disagreement on behaviors that i ve already explained Now i don t talk to anyone everyday i only feel safe with my bf and idk if that s because he is autistic cause another interesting things i learnt by the years is that I ve been friends for years with people who are exactly like him we talk from time to time and we maintain the trust in each other Does people with ADHD masking,ADHD
646,I observed my ADHD son playing dance and piano key arcade games and noticed that he was highly focused These games require him to concentrate and react quickly memorize information and repeat a lot This got me thinking if playing these games could potentially help train his attention skills I understand that games are different from academic or professional tasks However if we can gamifize studying or work assignments to make them similar to games Could ADHD person focus and motivate as they do when playing games Do you play games for training,ADHD

648,Was having New year's celebration party with my buddy his bf and my gf We were talking and he asked me about how my psychiatric evaluation went I replied and we started talking about ADHD Immediately my gf starts poking fun at how e-everything is related to ADHD I tell her that's un-ironically true I overeat at home because I'm bored and make implusive decisions that lead to food I used to use it as cope now it turned to good ol impulsive eating I forget to cook because hours easily go by when I play videogames poorly prioritize my home is often a mess I hate it but I just can't make myself clean sometimes starting tasks feels incredibly painful I can't study subjects I don't like or for longer than 15min at a time so I never got further than highschool as the worst student in class I used to do poorly at work because they switched me around different positions at the hospital 2-3 different work sites in a day and overload me with information I don't exercise because sticking to a habit of attending appointments is something I'm unable to do for more than 3-6 months while the gym is something I can always go on autopilot and avoid because I can't start a new tasks Everything sounds like a fucking excuse and I'm tired of people relating to it and saying but that's what everyone feels like Because it's NOT You have no clue how difficult it is to live as an unmedicated adult with ADHD How many other shit clings on like depression and social anxiety It's hard And I hate being made fun of for it Especially by a person that knows me that well My partner doesn't think ADHD is that big a deal and makes fun of me when I talk to someone about it,ADHD
649,I love the idea of this subreddit that people with ADHD can share ideas thoughts and experiences but given that this forum is so large it's almost impossible to have any form of meaningful interactions Also it doesn't really help that most people have ADHD the last one is kinda given but anyone knows if there's different subreddits Like one for hyperfixation one for executive dysfunction etc Anyone has a list of good ADHD subreddits,ADHD
650,I've been with my wife for 18 years married 10 She's been telling me that she's feeling more like a friend that sleeps next to me but is increasingly lonely I was affectionate when we got together but after the first 6 months that slowed down I love her and love being with her but I struggle with talking about my feelings Hugging and touch feels awkward and even if I wanted to it doesn't come naturally to even think about doing it She's always having to initiate sex or hugs she said that she doesn't even hear me talk to others about her and often I'll talk to people by saying I instead of we Our kids are now both in primary school and now that they don't need her as much she's wanting that connection from me and I'm struggling to remember to provide it Im thinking I should find a psychologist to talk to about it I also have Aphantasia so I don't know if it's the fact that I can't picture people when I'm near them that it makes it harder to have that connection I was only diagnosed 2 years ago at 41 I'm on meds now and while they are helping me get all areas of my life in order the intimacy is still a struggle Anyone else have this trouble and have tips I don't want her to feel alone I'm wondering if a daily calendar reminder to be affectionate will help Lack of intimacy Need help,ADHD
651,I am 27M Just got diagnosed few weeks back and for past 2 weeks my new hyperfixation is to learn everything about ADHD its driving my parents and friends crazy And I know they care about me and don't want me to think of myself as somehow reeling from a neurological disorder but to me its like I am reliving and understanding my whole 27 years of existence Damn I mean god damn this whole time I always felt like I am not dumb gullible yes but not dumb but there was no tangible evidence of it always doing things that aren't my priority not able to sit steadily for more than 30 minutes always clicking my pen on and off while studying always reading the plotlines of a TV series that others couldn't see that I thought to be obvious and now at 27 to the point of failure literally failing at everything misdiagnosed with depression than with sorrow from anxiety mimicing depression and now its ADHD after formal assesment Feeling like not everyone think like me to my parents I am difficult kid because I always have issues and ask too many godamn questions To my friends who always had problem that I was able to recall the trivial details about them from decade ago or that I could recall dialogues of movie that I only saw once or to think that while driving I am always angry and able to see things before they happen I mean literally it happened at times that I saw people getting into accident while I was in my car driving and observing from few feets away I mean man I can go on and on but turns out no one in my circle understands and its getting really lonely now So yes where to go from where It wasn't all my fault,ADHD
652,I have inattentive and impulsive type adhd and like most people who have Adhd I'm finding it so hard to find a job while I'm only just turning 17 it's still very hard to search for a job that I feel is comfortable for me I'm also extremely socially awkward and have social anxiety for most of my life I need to get a job but I don't want to have to be really social which just makes my options limited and I pretty much have barely any confidence in myself I've also have trouble with getting my friends to understand what issues I have with my adhd for example being able to concentrate blurting out words leaving stuff till last minute etc My friends don't understand how hard it is for me to focus on study that's important like school I barely even complete my assignments and get low grades for it and people make out like I'm the biggest idiot which I do try and explain it seems they don't get it in their head Sorry if this rant is a bit long but I've had really no one to talk to this stuff about If you want to give advice please feel free I'm sick of this,ADHD
653,I took my pill and I felt okay I told my doctor I wasn't depressed or anxious and I really felt like I didn't have ADHD she insisted that I have ADHD even though she has no clue what my personal life is like Honestly I felt like I was happy for a bit because I was producing my music like always and getting into it and did some nice vocals and what not and now and I was getting back on track but I took my pill and felt okay at first after a bit though I just started thinking about how I was sad because i just dont feel satisfied with my life right now Then it went into a rabbit whole and I realized the reason I am depressed is because I spent the first 13 years of my life living a very disrespectful cruel life because my family and environment was poor I went though a lot of traumatic wvents and I've been stressed out since day 1 and I haven't even been able to tell until recently 23 y o now Things most people would refuse to do I'd gladly do because I just dont care I feel like I live in the moment and I've built habits that most of society finds disgusting or obsolete in terms of how I talk up till I was around 13 or so So I just stay quiet self reflect often and observe the people around me and their personalities and if they are similar to popular tv show characters personalities and i tried distinguishing myself from these people because I do not like being apart of a stereotypical demographic and the only way for me to find that out was to completely separate myself from society for many years just to think for a long time I am the most happiest when I am alone from everyone in warm water and have something to occupy me I'm just not comfortable expressing the character I've been curating for the past 10 years since I realized that my ways weren't the best and I need to change and stop being a dick head I've built so much anxiety trying to change my ways of how I talk to or embrace my character around people because I want to be normal and I want to accomplish my goals and dreams in life But those goals and dreams have only been curated because I've allowed myself to understand the extremes of life and now the only goals that seem worth trying to accomplish are long term goals that will be unrealistic to achieve unless I start small I was discharged from the army where I wanted to actually die I wanted to die in the battlefield and for some reason that motivated the hell out of me I was focused and in shape and just living in the moment I was happy until I injured my hips and wrist then all of my motivation just plummeted ever since I started seeing doctors I've been even more depressed which I think exacerbates my anxiety and adhd I feel like being in a human being is the absolute worst outcome for consciousness I feel like there's another universe where there's some mega giant mindhive consciousness that's so powerful and big that the only way for THAT to relieve pressure and feel pleasure and to maintain is by decompressing itself into life that appears in our universe I feel like this all the time I am trapped and I know this sounds sketchy and might lead down a very dark path for me but it's just something I keep thinking about over and over again no matter what At first it was just a theory in my head but holy shit I literally do not even feel like I should be alive Everyone on this planet is cruel and toxic it's like I'm on a sinking ship in the middle of the ocean and everyone is pushing by on their nice fancy yachts and cruise boats with their family tree full of joy and excitement and banter then there me just in the cold water slowly sinking down I can tell there's people that have already sunk down and they're gone and I just don't know if I actually would rather be up on one of those nice boats or down below with everyone else Anyways I just spent Christmas and new years with a girlfriend I've been actually loving and it's the first time in 23 years where I felt like I was spending time with someone I loved Still in the back of my mind these thoughts ponder I feel like for every cause there is an effect which means that if you can understand what caused that effect then you can prevent that from repeating which may alleviate any mental health issues if you can use that problem solving method on your own life atleast I just dont know what to do I guess I'm posting this hear because I just dont know man life's a prison I guess and pain hurts I'm trying tobstay away from drama and be a good person and I'm trying to help the people around me but I'm getting no where and no one ever respects me and I'm always belittled Some times I just want to abandon everything I have and just go into the woods and never return and some times I feel like I'm the next Einstein obviously I'm only myself and I do not wish to take anyone else's glory but I feel like the intelligence that Einstein had everyone has it and he was just in the right environments to allow himself to prosper And I guess I'm trying to take everything I love and have currently and figure out what's worth it and what's not in order for me to get to where I want to be and idk I guess the combo of a lot of these things have been making me sad and the pill merely was a single trigger I wrote this after this all happened it's been about a week or two since all this happened im notbin a crisis or manic attack im relaxing and am happy currently but I figure I'd post this here because this stuff is still at the back of my mind Cheers Adderall has made me majorly depressed because it allowed me to actually think for once,ADHD
654,I usually get good sleep most of the days but the night before exam or a test I can't sleep at all I try to sleep but I just can't Small small things wake me up I have to give exams with just 3-4 hours of sleep and that's why I commit so many silly mistakes I started taking some medicine before sleep to help me sleep Etizolam 0 25 mg but even that doesn't work There hasn't been any night before exam that I have slept for even continuous 5 hours Not even after taking 2 tablets I seriously need help URGENT Exam Insomnia,ADHD

696,My son is about to turn 25 If you ask him what he wants to do with his life he will say he doesn t know the same answer for the past 10 years He took one semester in college and failed half his classes He can t keep a job longer than 3 months because he hates it or they let him go He is generally a nice kid I mean adult He doesn t drink or do drugs honestly He loves basketball Marvel movies video games and music but doesn t have any artistic abilities that I m aware of He is polite generally quiet He has no learning disabilities that I know of but maybe some mild ADHD not hyper at all more subdued He has three close friends who are all over the place as well but generally good-mannered people My son has no drive or ambition He enjoys having certain things mainly expensive sneakers but is not driven by money He has had seven years since high school to figure something out but he shrugs his shoulders if you ask him about his long-term plans or what he likes to do He asks no questions about life or careers He never wants to go to bed When not working he sleeps all day The only thing really traumatic that he experienced was a severe breakout with a girl in high school that he took really hard Also in high school he had severe stomach issues and one time lost a lot of weight For the most part he is over that I have to try to educate him on how the world works but he sits quietly or asks you not to discuss now He does not care that he has no formal education past high school which was a chore to get him to pass senior year He is just apathetic as if the answers will drop out of the sky one day We try not to spoil him and show him tough love but he can get very angry or explosive He is 6 4 and bigger than his dad now so those days of controlling him physically are over not that it is correct anyway He can slam doors and make abrupt moves that you don t want to get in front of Anyways you get the picture We are about to take the car away because with no job he can t make payments My mistake for signing because he had no credit and needed transportation for work and school and gave up on school I plan to sell the car but that will most likely lead to more isolation and limit his ability to work even further However I can t continue to bail him out Don t miss the message here I can t understand how someone doesn t have some basic ambition or won t commit to anything because they are afraid or don t like anything I don t know how to get through to him or help him anymore I m afraid he will end up homeless one day or living with five guys doing menial jobs his whole life Not to degrade that but he is actually pretty bright and capable of so much I feel I failed as a parent My wife and I have been good role models We are always available to talk and teach My daughter on the other hand soaks that up He says he doesn t like being around people that much He avoids family functions because people inquire about his life He has seen a therapist for many years and doesn t seem to be depressed Also he did some testing where the mild ADHD was discovered He takes no medication and has never complained that ADHD is a problem for him There may be some social anxiety there for sure He will go to the gym with me and do what I do but makes no suggestions on the workout and hardly says a word while there There is some discipline there but sometimes needs some pushing to finish The popular sentiment is to throw him out or ask him to pay rent Also some recommend the military which he has no interest in Pleas advise What to do when my 25 year old son doesn t want to do anything with his life,ADHD

709,Throughout high school I wanted to get tested for ADHD because I checked off a lot of the boxes and could relate to the common symptoms But because my parents weren't supportive and I didn't really know what it was at the time I pulled through the lack of time management and procrastination thanks to all-nighters and relatively easier high school classes I just finished my first semester of college and it went horribly I don't want to self-diagnose but I think ADHD could've played a part I started missing my classes procrastinated on my assignments and constantly felt like I wasted the day every day I really tried hard making plans and trying to lock in but pulling all nighters and drinking coffee also stopped working and as a consequence I ended with bad grades and am not happy about it because I think I should and could have done better When I brought the topic of adhd to my parents in high school they always told me that it's a fake disease I brought it up again this winter break and again they told me it's something that I can overcome if I try hard enough They also had doubts and a very negative view on adhd medicine because they are highly addictive and takes your money by making you over-dependent How true is this My college has a center to get tested for adhd but it takes months to make an appointment and said it is not enough to get adhd accommodation from the college if I ever need it Could I get any recommendations on the next steps Where should I go to get tested for ADHD and are they expensive without insurance If I indeed have ADHD how expensive is medication and are they safe Is there any budget-friendly medication that is available without prescription amp x200B Getting diagnosed as a college undergrad,ADHD

723,I have two unfortunate habits that I ve been indulging in quite a bit recently smoking and shopping Objectively I can see my stress levels have gone up so I m impulsively going to the things that give me little shots of happy chemicals Instead of trying to force myself to stop these habits never works for me I want to add things moments and experiences that give happy chemicals and hope that the increase of those will lead to a decrease in reliance on smoking and shopping kind of like the diet idea of starting by adding good foods to your day instead of cutting bad foods out I m working on building a routine and reading skin care and an on-going widget to-do project list are some of the things so far that I ve found had made me happy This includes finding not buying new potential books and products testing out new free apps and brainstorming projects I say this last part to show that I m not necessarily looking for lifestyle changes Even if you have an app that gives you a healthy burst of dopamine because it chimes when you accomplish something or you text your mom every morning or make sure step outside for fresh air before bed for just a minute I m open to the smallest or even silliest things Adding in dopamine,ADHD
724,Hi everyone What does your social circle look like I'm mostly curious about anyone who has friends who also have ADHD is that a good combination for you Which do you prefer if you have both neurotypical and ADHD friends I kind of really struggle connecting with people and since I've only recently gotten the official declaration of ADHD I thought it might be easier to connect with people who are similar in this aspect but then again might it make connecting more difficult Please let me know your experience Thanks Edit to add thanks everyone for sharing with me I really appreciate it What does your social circle look like,ADHD

727,I was diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD about a year ago and have been taking medications ever since to help me focus on my education I've tried a couple of different medications and they all have the same effect stimulating the nervous system by increasing heart rate blood pressure breathing metabolism sweating and decreasing appetite They have certainly helped me focus but I think they may also be hurting my long-term health I'm in my mid-20s and have noticed more grey hairs after I started taking the ADHD meds I'm less concerned about the grey hair than what it may mean for the rest of my body I'm worried that if these meds are damaging my hair follicles they may also be damaging other parts of my body as well I'd like to try ways to reduce the stress on my body while still getting the benefits of increasing focus from the ADHD meds I'm concerned that stress and stimulation are inseparable that you can't have one without the other amp x200B Edit I'm reading about the link between grey hair and ADHD meds and found some interesting things to note Just a warning this was a quick search so be critical According to this study https pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov 26687276 this study https pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov 24855887 and this study https pubmed ncbi nlm nih gov 26718459 the common ADHD medication methylphenidate is associated with increased oxidative stress in mice Oxidative stress refers to damage caused by reactive oxygen species ROS ROS are basically wrecking balls that mess with the biochemistry of the body According to this study https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC2929555 and this study https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles PMC4639963 greying hair is associated with increased ROS You can reduce ROS by increasing antioxidants I will try including antioxidant-rich food in my diet I might have greying hair due to ADHD meds and I'm worried about what that may mean for the rest of my body What can I do about it,ADHD
728,So I'm still on the LONG waiting list to get tested for ADHD and I'm still trying to figure out if stuff is potential ADHD or the already confirmed anxiety disorder But I was at a party having a good time when I noticed I couldn't stop walking around And if I stopped walking I would just start just like instinctively looking for other shit to do Then I went in an inner journey of discovery where I realized that I always have a main task but must ALSO have a B task running in the background Like I need to eat popcorn at the movies so I don't get bored while the story ramps up or I need to listen to music or watch a video if I'm doing something like chores or I just won't do it and if I force myself I eventually start talking to myself I tested this out and tried to just do one thing and I would inevitably start shuffling or wandering or humming or something It's like needing to have a baseline to a melody or it feels off but I don't know whether this is ADHD or my mind trying to drown out the inner callings of impending doom that my anxiety brings to the table or if I was just drunk So the A task and the B task thing Is that an ADHD thing Having an A task and a B task,ADHD

745,I have spent decades masking my symptoms to keep the peace with everyone in my life while unknowingly allowing internal conflict to fester It didn t occur to me that I may have ADHD until I got married and I had to get in sync with a whole other person All my little idiosyncrasies grieved my husband s idiosyncrasies and vice versa But we have determined to get help and find a system that works for us After recent talk with my mom apparently I was diagnosed when I was in the 4th grade with ADD a now outdated classification I remember it being discussed for a short while when I was struggling to pay attention in class and my mom suggested I have my desk moved away from the window and up closer to the front of class I know it came up in family discussions but I do not remember getting a formal diagnosis from a professional My father was very against me going on any medication or getting therapy His older brother was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and I guess the experimenting with meds caused distressing and violent personality changes in my uncle My dad had a pretty traumatic childhood and he came from a different generation so I m not mad at him He just thought he was doing what was best for me It actually became a point of contention between my parents so my mom just decided she d do the best she could and advise my teachers of behavior modifications to get me through school I m not mad at my parents because they did the best they could with the information they had But it is frustrating that I didn t get the help I really needed in my formative years I am in my 30s now and even though I don t think I m too old to learn new things I ve aged out of those developmental years so it s really that much more challenging Especially since certain bad habits have been deeply ingrained in my routine I ve done pretty well with getting my living space organized as clutter is a paralyzing trigger for me I still really struggle with calendars and agenda planning which is HUGE when you re married Ugh I have so much work to do but I m finally getting professional help Thank you for reading my rant I just needed to get that off my chest How ADHD of me to forget,ADHD
746,Finally got my shit together enough to go to my car payment portal and set up recurring payments only to find the website not loading This kind of roadblock always makes me want to cry Who knows when I ll be able to find this level of organized action again Any tips for making sure I actually circle back and don t rack up another 6 months of late fees Also welcome to share your war stories Running into roadblocks when I m actually trying to get things done makes me want to cry,ADHD
747,Hi I'm sorry of this is weird to ask but things are terrible and I don't know what to do My bf 21M has been diagnosed with ADHD since he's a kid he started taking Vyvanse when he was 14 I think When we met he was 19 he was SO thin I was scared he was barely eating and he told me it was his Vyvanse He went to his doctor and she prescribed him Concerta instead He gained weight and he looks a lot healthier now A couple of month ago he started complaining that he wasn't seeing much results with Concerta I told him to go see his doctor then so they can look together for another options He started to tell me that his doctor told him that medication wasn't obligatory and that he could only take it for school He stopped going to school and now he basically deals with his ADHD unmedicated Now I have nothing against not taking medication for something if you have other tools and mean to deal with your issues in an healthy way But the situation is that my bf has absolutely no idea how to manage his ADHD I've been wanting him to see a therapist because he has lots of anger management issues and emotional issues so that he could see if he can deal with his ADHD without meds but now he's a vegetable He smokes everyday and doesn't do anything in the relationship or the appartment unless iask him to do so we live together He has terrible tamper tantrums when I wanna have conversations with him on the subject I don't want to push him into taking his meds but I see the impact it has on our relationship I don't know what to do Any advice How to tell my bf he needs to get back on his medication,ADHD
748,At my last two jobs I tried different organizational methods but inevitably end up doubling the work for myself because I try a system it either doesn t work because the electronic folders are too divided up and cause a ton of searching in different folders for a file or info or my files are too cluttered and I can t find what I need quickly I find myself bouncing between different ways to try and stay organized excel spreadsheet electronic files etc but end up just having stuff spread all over the place and eventually get overwhelmed with figuring out what to do in order to reorganize and end up just imploding and more than likely being fired or written up at my job If anyone has any sage advice on organizational tips for someone who struggles IMMENSELY with organization I am open to help Thanks How to stay organized at work,ADHD

750,I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago during undergrad I decided not to take medication at the time due to being misinformed and fearing addiction I settled for accommodations by the university such as taking exams in a reduced noise environment and it helped me significantly Fast forward a few years later I m now in graduate school and I ve been on medication for 11 months My quality of life has dramatically improved and I m honestly kind of upset I didn t start taking my medication earlier This has made me realize I m not as informed as I thought I was and I now want to learn more about my ADHD I want to learn about the science behind it how my brain functions and what more I can do to manage the condition I d like to adopt better habits to increase my productivity and adapt to my fluctuating energy levels and attention cycles Could you please recommend me articles books or any other resources that have helped you I d greatly appreciate it Also happy new year everyone I want to learn about my ADHD,ADHD
751,Aloha I m a mid aged man was misdiagnosed and mistreated with bipolar disorder most of my life Lost my Mother due to this kind of misdiagnosis as well So my question is a bit weird also for myself so please apologize me if this not the right forum to ask I m having a hard time trusting doctors So when I take my dextoamphetamine some weird changes go on in my body and spiritual realm I feel more like a woman despite the fact that I m extremely homophonic in both states Was abused mostly by men all my childhood So I enjoy wearing ladies dress but I never dare to go out since I m a designer and have very sensitive visual culture and as a tall average man I look quite silly in ladies dress Not to mention that it s completely counterproductive since most women are attracted to well dressed men Is there anybody here with similar phenomena or anybody that can advise how to handle this strange new thing Thank you and happy success-rich new year to y all Gabi Dextro question,ADHD
752,Are New Years resolutions and all that kind of stuff a good and effective idea for those with ADHD or is it a terrible idea and a trap that just sets us up for failure and giving up I've always been bad with being able to decide anything in the first place and feeling bad when I inevitably fail to fulfill my promises or the year ends up completely derailed from the initial intentions I've also seen alternatives like making aspirations or visions instead of resolutions and goals or going all in on SMART goals etc What do you think Have they worked for you at all Are NY Resolutions a good or terrible idea for those with ADHD,ADHD
753,Half a year ago Pokemon Sleep did wonders for my bedtime schedule for one simple reason it made me feel like I was doing something by putting my phone down and gave me a little reward if I put my phone down at a certain time That lasted for about a month at which point all the non-sleep-related stuff got me to stop using it Berries meals candies research partners long animations long loading screens in my opinion all of that stuff distracts from the main point of GOING TO BED It demands too much of my time too many times per day What I'm looking for is an app that has these criteria 1 Makes me feel like I'm doing something by putting my phone down and not touching it 2 No extra bullshit maybe 15 minutes or so of things to do in the morning and or evening 3 optional An incentive to go to bed at a certain time Standard idle incremental games do not fit these criteria since most of them incentivize tapping around purchasing upgrades every few minutes I already play too many of them anyways There are a couple apps out there that are intended for work productivity that grow a digital tree while you don't touch your phone and I was going to try one of those out But I was curious if anyone knew of any other apps Substitute for Pokemon Sleep without the extra bullshit,ADHD
754,Ever since the Adderall shortage I ve noticed each batch I get affects me differently Idk if it s the manufacturer or what but wondering if anyone else has had this issue The last batch I had was strong and worked super super well This recent batch that I just finished is doing absolutely nothing like I m not even taking my Adderall at all Adderall Shortage,ADHD
755,Both my daughter and I are currently diagnosed with ADHD I have her on Quillivant which is a fantastic liquid form of Ritalin It works great but it's currently costing me 250 bottle even with the manufacturer coupon due to insurance refusing to cover Insurance says we need to try 2 approved formulary drugs before they will OK the Quillivant prescription So I got my daughter's doctor to prescribe one on the list which turned out to be Ritalin LA 10 Even though I'm an adult I currently take an ADHD medication designed for kids called Cotempla I'm on 8 4 extended lowest possible dose It has been working great for me but runs 50 mo It took a couple weeks to even find a store that had the Ritalin LA 10 in stock another ludicrous hoop insurance expects us to jump through-ugh and when I did it was the Granules Pharmaceuticals version I figured 10 gt 8 4 and if the Ritalin LA worked I could save myself money by switching off my Cotempla So I tried the Ritalin LA for 2 days It did NOTHING Nothing I thought maybe bad allergies were hindering its effectiveness but I went back to the Cotempla today and I'm completely normal again able to focus write this post go to the grocery store etc The past 2 days I've been barely able to drag myself out of bed What a ludicrous world we live in where insurance forces you to try something that's barely better than a placebo in order to get medication that actually works How many parents have given up or worse yet think that ADHD medication doesn't work based off these terrible generics I'm writing this as a word of warning If you get prescribed these generics keep going until you get something that actually works Cotempla has been great Quillivant has been great Don't give up Warning Generic ADHD medication may not be effective AT ALL My experience with Ritalin LA 10 Granules Pharmaceuticals,ADHD

758,Hi all 28M 6 185lbs Wanted to get something off my chest and possibly seek support I ve been diagnosed and medicated for Inattentive-type ADHD for almost five years now and the med I ve been on most consistently is Adderall XR I m on a relatively low dose 15mg and it s done wonders for my life overall which makes what s been happening lately so confusing These past few scripts I ve developed intense soul-crushing anxiety about taking my dose To the point where now for this month s script I haven t taken a single pill the med bottle hasn t been touched since I had it filled three weeks ago I m also on Guanfacine and Lisinopril and I ve been taking those no problem but for some reason my mind has fixated on the Adderall The most frustrating thing of all is that my symptoms are getting harder and harder to manage and I REALLY want to take it But every morning when I wake up and look at the bottle there s something inside me holding me back even though I ve been taking this medication for years and have never had any severe adverse reactions I think part of it is the fact that I keep getting different generics and I m always wondering What if THIS is the generic that messes me up I also have elevated blood pressure so of course then I start thinking Wait what if this one pill is the catalyst for a heart attack or stroke I know deep down none of this is rational but I m at a point now where the anxiety is overriding my basic sense and it s driving me insane I m definitely going to talk to my doc about this at my next appointment but until then I wanted to see if anyone has any insight It would be very much appreciated Thanks HiHats Been taking Adderall for years for ADHD-PI suddenly TERRIFIED to take it,ADHD
759,Is there anyone here that has both ADHD and OCD From my research I found that the two are essentially opposites ADHD is the inability to focus on one particular thing for a long period of time whereas OCD is too much focus on a particular thing an obsession I have nearly all of the classic ADHD traits and was diagnosed twice but now I'm wondering if it could be comorbid with OCD as well These are some things I noticed I crave some level of stability and routine but find it hard to achieve for more than a couple of weeks at a time because of XYZ factor that pulls my attention away I love novelty but often find myself doing specific activities over and over hyperfocus or obsession compulsion Even though my brain is usually a mess my room and house are very clean Part of the reason I keep it that way is so I don't lose things but it also just irks me when things are dirty or out of place I was also questioning whether it could be autism but I don't really encounter problems in social situations besides attention issues I know no one on here can diagnose me but I'm just curious if these tendencies are typical for people with ADHD or if there could be something else like OCD as well How is ADHD OCD different from just plain ol ADHD,ADHD
760,I have ADHD I struggle with being consistent with things I need to be more consistent with The children are wrestling and I want it to stop I know I ll have them write a list of other activities they could do and have them refer to that list whenever I catch them wrestling We do it for a week and then I forget about the whole thing and my kids are back to where we were when we started My daughter brings home school assignments We go 3 months straight of turning in the assignments the only student in the class with such diligence I m told at the first PTC of the year We go a week with no homework due to Thanksgiving and now she s missing a few assignments and I m struggling to find the old routine I bring up an awkward conversation with my husband that we need to talk about RIGHT NOW otherwise I m gonna forget and we re not gonna talk about this until we have a big blowout because it sat unresolved for too long What do you do to help cope with these kinds of things I ve heard there may be some therapies I can look into I ve done research on the drugs out there and they re scary AF and I am not comfortable pumping barely legal street drugs into my brain I may consider drugs if other options fail but I ve never done anything for my ADHD til now I just lived with it What options do I have Parents with ADHD,ADHD
761,Is there such a thing as taking ADHD meds in the afternoon evening I am guessing the issue would be that the meds would disturb sleep but was interested to hear what others think I am an undiagnosed adult but strongly suspect I have ADHD and I am considering whether medication would be helpful I often hear people talk about taking ADHD medication in the morning and then crashing in the evening In my particular case this sounds very counterproductive I can manage my symptoms much better when I am at work I work in an office setting Where I really struggle is after work when I come home to my wife and young kids So if the meds made me crash in the evening that seems like a recipe for disaster ADHD Meds for afternoon evening,ADHD

763,Initially getting my ADHD diagnosis was quite the relief like the missing puzzle pieces were now on the table And certainly a lot of the bewilderment now made all kinds of sense Knowing why I apparently felt different inside finally understanding that I was in fact navigating a world not made for me gave such relief and hope Thing is and what I failed to wrap my head around is how I was complicit in the dynamics I was now trying to change To be fair my upbringing set me up for codependency To wit I was born about six-ish weeks prematurely at just a few ounces over 5 lbs I dropped below that mark and consequently wasn't allowed to go home with my parents until I was back over 5 lbs Sometime later in life my mom let it be known directly to me that they weren't actually trying when I was conceived She also let me know that when I was somewhere in the 3-5 year-old range she from a kitchen caught sight of my dad throwing a football with me in the backyard She told me she watched long enough to see how he was throwing the ball harder and harder at my tummy and how I just wasn't catching it To the point I was reduced to tears She told me this years and years later when I asked why she didn't step in it was Oh I just saw the tail end There wasn't time But that wasn't the impression I got from the anecdote as originally shared with me Things like this happened time and time again dad would say things like What the hell's wrong with you stomping off in anger and frustration Turning to mom for comfort all I'd get is Say I'm alright If I could great if not I was afforded the opportunity to go relax and unwind Some 50 years later as I was working through these issues and in fact actually got my parents to join me in family counseling my dad's rejoinder was You were fine We left you to your own devices My mom's mantra Say I'm alright was so oft repeated that upon an occasion when I was being watched as a wee lad by a maternal grandmother wondering off I was discovered by my grandma hanging from the broken cover of a disused well shouting I'm alright Fun fact this is only one of two near-death experiences I had before the age of 5 The first was nearly choking to death at age 3 on a hot dog bun Insofar as I know other than an initial eval my parents did nothing No scans no therapy nothing Because I was alright I learned from the earliest age that what I felt and thought didn't matter what mattered was to give people what they needed so they would be happy with me To stuff and sublimate my feelings And now I'm coming up against resistance to the changes of this lifelong dynamic When I was 9 mom allowed me to look at Playboy at the barber shop at 10 she got me my own subscription Centerfolds went up on my bedroom wall My younger brother lost friends because of this mom did nothing other than close my bedroom door The pictures stayed up for about 8 years Later on I tested into the Gifted Program because mom wanted me to Likewise with children's theater acting and Plaza 3 Academy training In fact our relationship was good as long as I was doing what she wanted When I got engaged at 21 she actually thought it was appropriate for her to call my future FIL asking him what they could do to stop the wedding And all these years later when confronted about it she still insists that if I'd listened I would've saved myself all sorts of trouble Almost since I married my wife she's done nothing but demean her my wife's character to the point that when one of our now-adult children was in crisis some years ago and instead of coming alongside us family members called to shout at us tell us it was our fault and that we needed to be medicated We were reeling As I reflect upon it there are things my mom says which seem to make sense at the time but which fall apart under any scrutiny It's the difference between actually explaining something amp trying to explain something away Hearing Wil Wheaton's description of his childhood on the Bialik Breakdown really crystallized things for me It was never my job to be there for them as little boy to wear their blame and shame But that's what I did No more Late Adult Diagnosis the Ecstasy amp the Agony,ADHD

771,I recently got diagnosed and started medication but I m going through that process of dosage and correct medication After finding out what it s like to be so clear headed I started off on 5mg which worked at first but didn t last long At my next appointment I ll ask about different dosages to find the right balance when I started my meds and then lost it it drove me a bit nuts Being diagnosed cleared so much up and so many things made sense But now since my medication dosage isn t correct and on the days I forget it I realize how chaotic and all over the place I am was before I was described as high-strung in a way of just always being on the go constantly moving and my thoughts constantly going everywhere It s exhausting now that I know what it s like to be clear headed I can look back and see the areas where I was chaotic and all over the place but it was because my mind couldn t focus on anything and it was everywhere I had a hard time really connecting with people because I was always rushing things pushing things faster super driven And in some ways I m still like that but the medication is slowly balancing it when I don t forget to take it I loved how relaxed and chilled out I felt when I first started adderall but like I said it didn t last after a few days once my body adjusted I was focused and my mind wasn t everywhere I m just tired and hoping medication can actually help long term I m so tired of being all over the place,ADHD
772,I grew up in a strict religious cult wasnt allowed to make friends outside of cult was physically and mentally abused and most of my life outside of church and education was spent alone in my bedroom This lasted all the way until I was 24 when I broke away from church I then broke away from my family when i was 28 I was undiagnosed ADHD until I was 30 I am getting tested for medication soon My main issues are focus socialization and trauma dumping I tried a therapist and all they focused on was the cult i grew up in and the religious aspects of it I was out mentally of that cult at the young age of 8 I masked my way through church until i could courageously leave The cult didn t bother me much it was my abusive family and my limited social interactions But when a therapist asks for my history how do i keep from trauma dumping and steer them to focus on my main issues I don t have any friends always had a hard time keeping them because I would either blurt out weird comments trauma dump or ask to hangout too much I finally am dating someone who is allowing me to be me helping me heal and isn t abandoning me over anxiety or emotions He has tons of friends but at parties im neither seen or heard despite efforts I m only good at 1 1 interactions if I REALLY focus on having the conversation solely about the other person and not myself But then i can never be myself and i feel emotionally isolated all over again How to find the right therapist,ADHD

780,I'm very scared because of my ADHD limits but I'm seriously considering changing careers a bit I've been a programmer most of my life but thanks to hyperfocus and random interests I've been working with electronics for the past year I want to do it professionally and I have the network to start from a junior position My anxiety has kept me from changing before because I should commit to my current job and good things will come or if I quit now then I'll quit again from the next thing i get obsessed on I don't want to be a failure and currently I'm good in my job but I feel this is different because for a year I've been doing electronics on the side had the best time of my life and regardless of the setbacks I love it How can I focus and commit to it Have you ever changed careers before Is there any advice you would like to share Have you ever changed careers How hard is to actually do it and not abandon it,ADHD

782,I really like the idea of my previous adhd drawing so I thought I d give it an other try I thought that if I use a bigger canvas I ll be more inspired to finish it so it isn t a waste And I ll use a ruler an measure out equal sections so like the last time the H has the same space as the A And on the back I ll write down all the important information like which part has the right color if I get distracted by something else Then I drew outside the lines but I can fix that with a black outliner Then the border had a different size on one of the edges And I used the wrong shade how is that even possible I prepared Into the trash it goes Maybe third time is the charm Maybe a smaller size than this but bigger than the first And I ll put back the pens I didn t use And I ll draw one part of the painting at once Outline gt Color gt Shadow gt Details Finish the letters and take a break before I ll draw the background Third time is the charm What it feels like to me,ADHD
783,I am currently seeking a new psychiatrist since a I moved to a new state but more importantly because b my parents who do not approve of any narcotic medication IE Adderall called my current doctor and told them a grossly inflated story about how I was abusing my medication never have taken more than prescribed if anything I often take less and save it due to the shortages and also that I have an eating disorder I don t but it s easy to believe because I have a naturally low BMI and long story short my doctor said she would no longer see me and if I asked her for a reference letter she would mention to any new practitioner that she felt I was no longer an appropriate candidate for stimulants Long story short can she actually say these things even though she has no evidence for these claims besides literal heresay Or for HIPPA reasons does the chart that she shares simply list my former diagnoses and medication history If anyone has answers or even advice about how to move forward I would really appreciate it parents tried to sabotage my ADHD treatment What information is my former psychiatrist legally required or allowed to share with a new provider,ADHD
784,I ve been medicated for adhd now for a little over ten years It really bothers me when people tell me or try to advise me that I don t need medication or I don t need it everyday and to skip weekends or something like that And why do I feel like this really only happens to people with adhd and no other medical conditions Before I started on medication and whenever I have to go through withdrawal I become a depressed zombie couch potato who is very avoidant I honestly wish people would think twice before giving their two cents about others medication Is this any of my business Am I this person s doctor Is what I m about to say really necessary Have i brought this up before and did it make them uncomfortable I feel like I had more to add to this but I ll just stop it here PLEASE DO NOT TAKE MEDICATION UNLESS IT IS PRESCRIBED TO YOU AND ONLY TAKE AS DIRECTED Have a lovely day You re doing amazing Anybody else get told they don t need medication by people other than doctors,ADHD

801,I m 42 I had an injury then severe depression that made me give up full time employment around 5 yrs ago and move interstate back to my mum s I don t know my dad It s just us two For the last few years I ve slowly gotten better I socialise a little bit more again I work a day here and there but now looking for a few short shifts a week to increase my working My physical injury is getting better and my chronic pain ain t as bad I still struggle hard though and I think my mum s mental health issues have broken me I was doing ok before moving back I was dreading it I knew that the way she just thinks I m a manipulator and lazy and irresponsible was going to suck But I didn t think it would actually traumatise me as an adult No way did I think I could be dragged down so hard and I actually feel like my mind is shattered irreparably by living here again The things she says to me and the way she perceives me absolutely has made my recovery and my self help much slower than it would be with proper understanding and emotional support I ve shown her so many videos and talks which I had to force her to finally watch But still she says it s all in my head and doesn t believe me that I have it She is always threatening to call my psychiatrist to ask him if I really do have it It s crazy I have Vyvanse prescription for a reason She also says she doesn t need to learn about ADHD coz that s my problem not hers When I have begged her to look into some basic quick info she has said multiple times why do I have to become some expert on this stuff when it s got nothing to do with me And if she ever concedes sometimes in odd occasions that maybe I do have ADHD then still other people with ADHD do not live and behave like I do I m truly lazy and irresponsible and do not care That s what she says openly to me all the time I don t use ADHD as an excuse btw I rarely talk to my friends about it Just like chronic pain I rarely talk about stuff like that But coz it s vital and also both my psychiatrist and psychologist says I should try and talk with my mum about it so she can feel better and understand what s going on I try to do that Also I do make changes and learn new skills and habits I m also getting fairly knowledgeable about mental health and work on myself all the time My friends and my doctor psychiatrist and psychologist all say every few months that I ve made massive strides and am noticeably more healthier upbeat and actively doing things in my day to day life more and more as time progresses But when I try and show that to my mum she always says this you re not doing as good as you think you are She has said recently no parent would put up with a son like you No one You'd be on the street I used to put it out of my mind coz she has had a lot of traumatic experiences but now I have lost any will to compartmentalise her ideas about me and I'm literally choking She pulls me down so hard Like when she learns about something with ADHD that is so in point about me that would explain so much especially for a parent learning about their son she goes yeah but what has this got to do with you She wasn't always this bad and it kinda makes things worse And when she says something like that I'm lazy or other adhd people don't have the problems I do Or like she said the other day you've just got bad habits It's got nothing to do with adhd People with ADHD still get the things they need to get done You don't even clean your car or look after anything Which isn't really even true I know I'm not that bad overall But when she does this I cannot get it out of my mind For days Weeks even I have gone a week with it being my waking thought until I go to sleep I just want her to even just listen to what I'm saying and realise I'm not anything like she thinks and actually take a moment to see that I'm really trying and realllly struggling But she won't And because she won't I will just continue to dwell on that exact thought and not move past this And the next horrible thing she says about me will break my brain that little bit more and pull me down a little more deeper And coz I can't work full time yet I have to stay here I know my psychologist especially says unfortunately I have to not have any expectations that she will ever come around and work with me and accept I have these struggles and other things out side of just ADHD because she probably won t ever provide me with that But I fail massively there I kinda don t have expectations But that s not even the problem I wish I could cut her negatively out of my brain and not let it occupy and of my time But instead it s just there growing bigger and bigger and there is barely any room in my thoughts of anything else anymore Mum You re just lazy and you really just don t care Me utter despair,ADHD
802,Hello I m 21M finding it hard to motivate myself to do even the simplest of tasks Every day i put off doing important things like schoolwork and other tasks that i m supposed to be doing The only time i m actually motivated to do something is when i find something that i m actually interested in or there is a clear purpose to the activity For example the 11 months that i spent during my mandatory military service i found that there was a clear purpose and objectives to accomplish a determined schedule to follow Looking back at it i was quite fulfilled mentally so it was quite easy for me to achieve my goals and my motivation was high Another example would be a robotics project in uni a couple of months ago i was really invested in it and would often stay at school til midnight to work on it But after getting my grade i just fell back into the hole where i couldn t care less about it Nearly every day i spend mindlessly scrolling reddit instagram reels and watching youtube or sleeping because i cant be bothered to do anything else I want to find things interesting and do the things i want but its like my brain is saying nah not worth it Its driving me nuts every night i tell myself that tomorrows the day when i start doing things But when tomorrow finally arrives i find myself in state where my brain just refuses to do anything that requires any extra effort I feel like the only times i can actually focus on doing things is when there is a clear end goal purpose and is actually interesting to me Everything was fine for me during high school but after i finished my military service and went to uni everything just like crumbled I am diagnosed with depression and adhd for which i am taking drugs 20mg escitalopram and 54mg concerta and they do help in keeping my mind from racing and keeps the bad thoughts away But i still feel 0 pleasure and lack the motivation to do things During uni i have started to consume excessive amounts of caffeine and nicotine energy drinks dont really do anything to me now i dont even know why im drinking them anymore i only feel it when i drink it rigth after taking my drugs and nicotine is just a thing to feel something in my brain i feel like its the only thing that makes my brain experience any pleasure or stimulates it What are the things i could do to get myself more engaged in life get myself to actually get things done I feel like there is so much missed potential that i cant access anymore and its starting to seriously affect my mental and physical health Please and Thank you Got diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 21 need your help and advice for dealing with it,ADHD

806,The straw that broke the camels back I talking with someone the other day and they mentioned they were looking for support because they couldn't work because of their ADHD I suggested they speak with their doctor and they told me they didn't have a doctor because they were self diagnosed they said people only get a diagnosis to get medication and I don't want to take medication I know they weren't directing this at me and they probably had no idea about my neurodivergence but I've been hearing this for decades and it put me off getting assessment and support for a long time I just can't move past this anger I think it's because what they said is all rolled up with the years of struggle I've had in my own life and the shame of asking for help I know this person is struggling too because no one would say shit like that unless something was seriously wrong with them there's the anger guys Logically I know they're struggling and need help and these beliefs are getting in the way of their own journey What can I say to people that's for the best here Tired of hearing people only get diagnosed to get drugs,ADHD
807,Note These are my personal whinings There are no people in my life who I can talk to about this issue nor who will take me seriously even if i did That's why I decided to pour my heart out here People think ADHD is just about lack of attention and forgetfulness Yes these are bad but I wish that were all It is hard for me to focus but I can achieve it if i try hard enough But it is harder to leave something after focusing on it Why are you still on that question Solve the other questions You always do the same thing wasting your time But no if that were all I would deal with it somehow No the problem is everthing Everything about me is overwhelming and unstable People don't understand this My thoughts my actions and worst of all my emotions I can't control anything Why can't you be like the others Why are you always different Don't you have two eyes two ears two hands Why are you always like this Even though I've been experiencing the same thing for years I keep trying and I always fail What else can I do Is there any other option I'm in a cycle and even though I know the outcome I get disappointed every time and hate myself more Even as a little child thinking I wish I would die so it would finally end can't be normal it shouldn't be normal I'm tired of being more immature than my peers You were always asking me why I was feral and antisocial dad Because of this Because I was constantly ostracized and bullied She is such a cry baby This is the thing that makes me hate myself the most I hate crying even over the smallest thing I hate crying while writing this I hate that no one not even my own family takes me seriously because of this I hate being gullible and naive I hate getting excited worried tripping over the most casual things I hate constantly focusing on small details but not being able to see the big picture I hate constantly having to worry about unnecessary things even to do the simplest task Even though I act like a perfectionist nitpick about the details when completing a task I hate doing worse and spending more time than everyone else I can't do anything properly I can't even wipe my ass properly I just want it to end Yes I get professional help At least medication Therapy sucks My family thinks I'm exaggerating the situation even though they don't say it directly It's all about the head You have to work it out in your head Yes it's bad but you could have been like those kids who can't eat properly can't make eye contact You're normal I used to forget my things when I was little too Is that so dad Did you forget your things at school every day Did your teacher throw away your belongings just because of that Yes I know there are people worse off than me but aren't there also people better off than me Aren't you're just trying to ignore the problem Or just trying to convince me I'm normal There is no one around me who understands how difficult this is I know they don't know how hard it is because they haven't experienced the same thing But I can't stand drowning in these emotions anymore People think ADHD is just about lack of attention and forgetfulness,ADHD
808,Im on probation and it's been extended to another 2 month and will be the last straw for the company if I fail I feel so sad and ashamed of myself I'm trying really hard and yet I'm still failing I'm not dumb I know how to do my job it's just my focus goes out the window with slightest background noise or interruption and I end up writing the wrong thing my job requires me to write down lots of numbers and I'm not allowed to get a single digit wrong in my paper work My doctors are rubbish I've been asking for a long time to get medicated apparently I'm on a waiting list but it's been 2 years now even when I called to ask if I'm still on the list which they confirmed it made me wonder if maybe I'm not that bad and that I don't need it and now it turns out I'm way worse than I thought Im about to tell my boyfriend about it today which is going to be embarrassing because he admires me a lot and thinks I can do anything that I put my mind too And I can't tell my parents about it because they don't understand they are the stero typical shitty parents that call me lazy or say I'm not trying hard enough I'm fed and depressed I wish was normal I might be loosing my job thanks to ADHD,ADHD
809,I struggle a lot with being thoughtful of other people in my life It's not that I don't care or that I don't appreciate these people it's that if I'm not interacting with them right there and then my mind will just go elsewhere I'm terrible at being the first to message at planning gifts for people at organizing meetups and it's getting to a point now where my social circle is very small because of it and it's taking a heavy toll on my relationship with my girlfriend I want to be the sort of thoughtful and attentive person that would make all these people happy but I just don't know how to start changing myself I'm worried that soon I'll just be genuinely alone because I don't know how to keep people around unless we're just forced to be in the same place every day like when I was in school or university or before I started working from home full-time EDIT Just for clarity I'm not asking for help in making new friends and relationships I want to keep and nourish the ones I have now because I care about them so much How do I become more thoughtful in my relationships,ADHD

814,I ve been going through the videos by Dr Barkley after procrastinating doing that for a bit They definitely gave me a better understanding of the deficits on the level of the brain that may underlie common challenges in people with ADHD may explain some of the symptoms we struggle with I 36F have been diagnosed 4 months ago and am taking medication and I do see an improvement in focus in situations where it s needed What I am still trying to figure out is how to modify some of my behaviour and better manage my ADHD In his videos Dr Barkley mentions that things have to happen at the point of performance this is something I ve unknowingly implemented in some areas e g my antidepressants I take at night are right next to my bed ADHD meds on the kitchen counter keys on a specific hook cleaning equipment in separate places so I can clean something quickly etc I have a small studio which also helps manage things at home Dr Barkley also mentions that visual cues posters cards sticky notes etc are tools that can be used e g for forgetfulness as well as planners that can also be used for time management Now I used to be able to use a planner to some extent a few years ago before the pandemic lockdown messed things up Not sure if I used it correctly but I found a system that worked for me I think I used the GTD method in combination with a bullet journal I ve tried to get back into it but I can t figure out how to remember that I wanted to use it A few years ago I was working on a PhD and had it with me next to me at all times which obviously helped But since I had to quit my PhD due to undiagnosed ADHD making me fall apart during lockdown I had been working at a bakery and don t need a planner for that I ve been working there for longer than I planned partly because when I come home on my days off the thought of using my planner to plan applications or track other things does not cross my mind I can t seem to figure out what the point of performance would be in that case and how I can use that to make a habit out of using my planner sticking to the plan is a separate issue I ve tried visual cues but they blend into the background reminders on my phone also didn t work my brain just ignores them and I need to work on that as well There may also be some anxiety avoidance behaviour going on which I ll work on with my therapist but has anyone who was struggling with this habit found a way It has to be a manual planner I got to distracted on my phone when trying to use apps TL DR I know the benefits of a planner and want to make it a habit of using it again but don t know how to remember checking it Point of Performance how to implement that for using a planner,ADHD
815,I don t know what to do anymore I use alarms and reminders on my phone and laptop but dismiss them unconsciously or let them vibrate and ring for hours I tried using paper and pen to schedule my day my week but forget looking at it I have a smart watch that vibrates to tell me stuff but I don t feel it I need someone to stand beside me and scream and touch me and block my view to have a chance of changing my current objective I get so sucked in at times and I don t know if my medication is helpful or making things worse but I know that it flattens my emotions and I don t like that I take antidepressants as well and feel more depressed when taking ADHD meds on top so I don t use them everyday I feel like I need somebody to check in on me every few hours to announce the next steps I should be taking and forcing me even physically if needed but I m an adult and have to deal with that on my own Maybe if I had a pair of glasses going red and hindering my sight whenever I should switch tasks and which I couldn t get off would help Maybe I need a screen in wall size that I couldn t ignore demonstrating my to do list and events and matching smart home bulbs going red at a set time and speakers blasting horrible music and those devices would only stop torturing me if I really really proceeded with the next task maybe then I would be able to live on my own I m exhausted I need someone to scream at me,ADHD

822,So the title is not very well put but I'll try to explain it better here So I've always been terrified of being roofied as probably every other woman when going out I also have anxiety which of course doesn't help Since I'm taking my adhd medication it's gotten way worse I haven't gone out since and even tho I'm not a huge party person I think I would have without the medication I'm just terrified of what would happen if I was roofied and on my medication I take 30mg of elvanse or vyvanse as I think it is broadly known as I know I might be paranoid but does anyone know what would happen Being roofied in general can become quite dangerous so I'm asking myself how much more dangerous medication makes it I'm thankful for any thoughts or tips on that matter I'm afraid of being roofied because of my medication,ADHD

825,So basically just posting this to get a rough estimate on how many people need overstimulation when trying to finish one specific task For example when I am watching a lecture series or a video for whatever reason I will have to do something else with my hands or listen to music in the background while the video is playing You might be asking why would I do this well its a lesser evil in a sense where I won't veer off what I wanted to do originally because that part of me that wants to go completely off track is kept at bay by these 50 other stimulations that are not as large But for goodness sake is it annoying as occasionally I would require a 100 of my attention on the main task but if I stop my music or random typing tests I will just completely veer off track Does anyone else face this And is there a way to lets say suppress this behaviour the meds do well but its just not enough of a kick For context was diagnosed with ADHD around 4 years ago now and still struggling heavily to get shite done currently on 50 mg of Vyvanse The Need for overstimulation to get tasks done,ADHD
826,I really struggle with housework I don't know how to get better Will medication fix me What else can I try I've been recently diagnosed with primarily inattentive adhd as an adult I've always struggled with housework but I'm only just starting to understand why I simply forget that jobs exist I can't even remember to clean my teeth EXAMPLES The laundry I've constantly got an overflowing laundry basket floordrobe but I don't remember that I need to do laundry until I go to bed at which point it is too late Dishes are another example we eat on the sofa whilst watching TV and I put my dishes down and just don't notice them pile up until the room is so messy that it becomes visually stressful I'm convinced that we only have clean dishes because we have a dishwasher and I end up washing everything at the weekend I forget to empty the cats litter trays and normally have to get reminded by my wife because they've gotten really bad my wife is pregnant so can't touch the litter I'm constantly just putting things down in random places and forgetting about them my wife describes it as a trail of chaos I never hoover or dust my wife can't because she has allergies unless we have guest coming over or I'm having a rare obsessive cleaning day Which happens maybe once every 2 months and then I'll spend the whole day cleaning and tidying everything until I'm exhausted I just want to not constantly feel overwhelmed by mess We have our first kid on the way so I know it's only going to get more difficult THINGS I'VE TRIED I've tried a few things with mixed results Chore Chart pictured This worked for a while but then I just started forgetting to use it Plastic Crates We've got several plastic crates that we've designated for moving things from room to room more efficiently These are great when I remember to tidy up Reminders on my phone I started ignoring them after 3 days Productivity apps Work great for my job I forget to use them with for housework TLDR I struggle with housework because I forget it exists What can I do Will medication fix the problem Feel like a Slob Will medication help What can I do,ADHD

831,Obligatory Disclaimer I'm not looking for any medical advice but suggestions from peers with diagnosed or sub-clinical ADHD who might have undergone similar situations like me TL DR Have been taking generic Dexedrine for several days after break Not feeling anything positive or negative at all except for slightly reduced appetite which I always experience when taking ADHD medication Should I be concerned Timeline of my medication Started my latest round of medication in August Stopped medication at the beginning of December because I had to visit another country and I forgot to ask my psychiatrist to write me a medical report Started medication again this Thursday 28 Dec My prescription Dexamphetamine generic Dexedrine 30 mg day but my psychiatrist let me take as much or as little as I'd like as long as the dosage fell into the 30 mg day limit I can also ask them to increase the prescription to as high as 50mg day without much trouble My current situation since I returned Did not take medication on the first several days because I was excited to come back and anything seemed like a breeze Used a small daily dosage to reorient myself but it did not do much except for making me less prone to hunger I have been raising the dosage very quickly and now I'm taking the prescribed dosage During this time I did not feel any side effect excluding low appetite The novelty of travel faded and again I found it difficult to physically move myself face challenges or redirect my attention Previous dosage and outcome Dosage Usually 20mg daily 10mg in the morning and 10mg at midday 10 10 Sometimes I split the second dose into two for longer duration 5mg taken at midday and 5 in the afternoon 10 5 5 On rare occasions when I felt particularly good I would half my second dose and not take a third one 10 5 when life became overwhelming I would take three full doses 10 10 10 What I felt after taking medication All of my feelings and sensations were very mild if I felt anything at all I did not feel anything that clearly indicates the medication was working no inner voice getting quiet or suddenly being able to start doing things or mind getting drastically clearer Sometimes I got tired after 4 to 8 hours Overall effect on my executive functioning My focus was better but I still had to consciously suppress bad habits I developed as coping mechanisms Little improvement on task initiation and switching My sub-clinical anxiety lessened or almost gone Picked up dexamphetamine generic Dexedrine again after three weeks break but apparently it no longer works,ADHD

834,I ve lived in this apartment for 2 years now and all of a sudden all of my neighbors are being extra loud all day long The walls are thin uninsulated so my apartment is just a big drum My biggest overstimulator is noise I absolutely cannot stand certain types of noise and people talking constantly absolutely kills me It s so overwhelming I ve wanted to cry all day My one neighbor has been on the phone non stop for weeks I can t make out the words it s not quite like they re in my apartment It s really muffled but sometimes they ll laugh really loud or yell in excitement about something I really don t want to ask them to keep it down because for the most part I know they re talking at a normal volume and this is a me issue The wall we share is to our living rooms it s about 24 feet long and our couches are against the same wall I ve thought about switching my couch and TV but I don t want them to have to deal with the sound of my TV against their head and my front door would open right into the couch which I don t love Plus I doubt it d be enough of a change sonically I ve done a ton of research on it and now it s become a hyperfixation which is meaning now I m even more sensitive to it than usual because I m hyper aware of it Love this brain Anyways I know there s not a ton I can do since I can t resurface the walls but has anybody experienced something similar and found something that helps I have an air purifier that provides some white noise I ve thought about putting a bunch of book shelves behind the couch and filling them with books and blankets but I have no idea if this would do anything since we share the entire wall assuming the sound would still bleed on the sides of the shelves I ve also got upstairs neighbors that are professional upstairs neighbors which usually I can ignore but when I m overstimulated like this I become extra sensitive to every footstep Lastly my neighbor on my other side has a dog that yelps and cries any time it s alone I ve called noise complaints twice but nothings changed I woke up this morning to it which set me off on a terrible foot My home that I used to love so much has become a prison and I can t move for at least 4 months while I save up for rent deposit somewhere else and I have no idea how I m going to survive I ve basically been living with my noise cancelling headphones in and I fucking hate it I just wanna be comfortable in my home I don t know what happened it s like a month ago everyone forgot how thin our walls are and started being loud Any advice would be really appreciated If I could at least reduce the noise from the neighbor I share a wall with by like 50 while I m sitting on my couch it would make such a huge difference Otherwise any coping tricks or ways to bring your nerves down in situations like this I m desperate I m so over stimulated by noise and my neighbors have been extra noisy What can I do I m so overwhelmed,ADHD

844,So a couple months ago I 23M started taking the generic for Focalin a stimulant medication for ADHD I've tried stimulant and nonstimulant medications for ADHD since I was a kid and NONE of the stimulants had ever worked long-term because I always built up too much of a tolerance to them The only effective meds I found was Strattera for two years but because they were making my heart beat too fast I had to stop them It was SO frustrating to have found something that worked and have to stop it even if I agreed with the reason why amp x200B Anyway I started on Focalin which apparently I had tried before when I was a kid but I now only take it 2-3 times per week or 4-6 doses since they're instant-release This is what I attribute to why it's worked longer than any other meds I don't take it on weekends but I also don't take it on low-effort days when my job requires less brain-heavy work from me My productivity has skyrocketed and I have so much more energy after work as well amp x200B I understand that not everyone can do this because a lot of jobs require the same effort every day and other people need to focus on days off work too but it's worked for me and I know I can't be the only person for whom this has worked could work for Let me know if you've tried anything similar Of course with your doctor's psychiatrist's approval These are the first stimulant meds that have worked long-term for me and I think I know why,ADHD

858,Hey y'all I've got a problem that I have no idea how to fix work around Just a bit about me I'm an older male in my early 40s suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident I was not at fault lady blew a stop sign back in 2001 This has also resulted in panic disorder severe generalized anxiety disorder with agoraphobia Adult onset ADD Predominantly Inattentive type minor depression OCD and an entire back that either has bulging or herniated discs from L3 to S1 on S2 with retrolesthesis at S1 on S2 So I'm on disability and it sucks Anyhow here's my problem I have always loved doing calligraphy and it's one of the few things I can still do at a high level My problem is in any given week I spend more time fiddling around with my equipment than I do actually practicing calligraphy I like to do pointed pen script like Copperplate and Spencerian because it helps to settle my mind when the medication fails to do so I take 70mg of Vyvanse daily and about an hour and a half after I take my Vyvanse I start to feel like I want to do some calligraphy So I grab all of my stuff pens ink pencils etc etc and will carry them around with me dang near all day and never even sit down to start my calligraphy practice It's maddening On the off chance I do sit down to practice I end up trying to repair a flange clean all of my nibs and dry them off real nit-picky shit It's driving me insane and it has started leaking into other areas of my life Like showering I will take a shower dry off and get dressed and just stare at YouTube video I don't have the slightest interest in How do I actually stop all of this preparing and actually start doing the things I want to do By the end of the day I am legitimately angry that I ended up wasting another day Add about 3 or 4 of those types of days together and I decide the hell with it all and quit trying to practice my writing at all and will either lie in bed in pain or fixate on something else that isn't important like my socks This is all in conjunction with my panic disorder which I would say has ruined my life I take Klonopin for it 3 times a day and Zoloft twice a day and I am still a mess Sometimes I just want to give up but that is not an option for me Any and all help is appreciated Thank You Problem Actually Doing Anything,ADHD

869,I know that the idea of a dopamine detox it self is still a debated topic But the truth for most people is that constant small hits of dopamine social media porn or any form of quick fix media is usually a bad thing as it desensitizes the brain to dopamine so when your brain gives you dopamine for something useful it won t mean as much I have tried this and am currently doing at as it seems to help slightly But the only problem is that I simply feel so so bored all the time and constantly have the urge to give into the quick dopamine that I know I can get using things like social media So my question is how can I not be so bored all the time while trying to minimize short lasting cheap dopamine And is trying to minimize those forms of dopamine even useful having ADHD Does dopamine detox work for ADHD,ADHD

874,Hi everyone 42yoF here Due to the medication shortage in Australia I've had to switch from Vyvanse to Ritalin LA Ritalin just got approved here for retrospective prescription diagnosis after 18yo under the PBS so I'm not paying through the nose for it and my psych thinks it will be better for me as I have classic mixed ADHD diagnosed at 40yo I've been taking the Ritalin for about a week and I feel TERRIBLE I have buggerall motivation I feel like everything is overwhelming I have absolutely no energy I'm not interested in anything I feel incredibly drowsy and like I could cry any moment I'm still not interested in eating until later in the day I've never been able to stomach breakfast even prior to diagnosis meds unless I do PT as soon as I wake up I remediate by taking my meds with a protein fibre shake with milk in the morning and it's comforting to know there is at least something in my belly until lunchtime Has anyone else gone through the transition between these two medications What effects have you felt How long before you felt normal again Vyvanse made me incredibly anxious and led to panic attacks about 5 hours after taking it so I do hope changing to Ritalin helps with that and I do understand there will be a period of adjustment between the two where I feel like crap but it would be nice to know how long I should expect to feel this useless Switch 40mg to 30mg Ritalin LA,ADHD

876,When you take stimulant medication it s not a end all perfect fix Stimulant medication by all means can help tremendously but I think it s important to understand the biochemistry behind it Stimulant medication down regulates dopamine You experience a crash because of withdrawal and dopamine down regulation Its not something wrong with your med These medications arnt magic They help you manage your condition and learn to live with it I believe therapy and medication is extremly effective but many people in this group need to understand that this medication is not a perfect magical key to ADHD New ADHD people need to know this,ADHD

888,I have had a diagnosis and have been medicated for ADHD for almost four years now More on that below Over the last 6-10 months I have found myself struggling with what seems like worsening ADHD symptoms and I ve spoken about this with my psychiatrist recently She has another patient whose brother recently encouraged him to ask her psych about prescribing him clonidine She was reluctant at first but it seems both men have had positive results and so she recently offered to have me try a very low dose in addition to maintaining my current medication I do trust she has done additional research and is well-informed on the medication aside from having limited experience prescribing it in such a way I m wondering how many others have had this suggested to them and what experiences have been like whether you decided to try it or not My understanding is that clonidine is typically prescribed as a blood pressure medication and I have some concerns that if I start it it s something I will have to take more or less indefinitely or spend a lengthy time weaning off of it It is also prescribed sometimes as a sleep aid so I m worried it could make me drowsier than I often already feel Background info I started on Concerta but ended up better on Foquest With this current psychiatrist I have tried alternatives including Vyvanse with poor outcomes I m back to Foquest 55 mg and I definitely notice a difference when I don t take it but I m still struggling a fair amount even with it A higher dose does more harm than it s worth food becomes repulsive I get anxious and feel unwell I also have severe anxiety and persistent depressive disorder and medicate my anxiety somewhat successfully with Cymbalta obviously anxiety isn t as simple as a switch to be turned off by meds I m in my 30s female and I m back in university to pursue graduate studies so my mental load or demand during semesters is high But I m struggling with some pretty basic focus-related issues this isn t just a pursuit of optimized performance seeking perfection Clonidine for ADHD,ADHD

890,For context me my mom and my brother all have ADHD My dad does not My brother is 22 years old and hasn't done anything except work a part time job since they graduated high school They were diagnosed at age 12 They live in my parents basement for free is disgusting since they do not clean rarely take showers and don't help around the house I am 20 and currently in university my mom is 52 and has a successful career in healthcare and we both had little to no support We were undiagnosed all our life and just got diagnosed We are both fed up with my brothers behaviour and excuses to not do anything They would call us ableist for suggesting or giving advice and start yelling at us I recently called them out for everything that I let slide over the years But their attitude is getting too much for me and my mom to handle They've been pouting all around the house and taking only to my dad instead of me about it My dad has been enabling this for too long He got upset with me for calling out my brothers Telling me that it shouldn't concern me and that my brother has severe ADHD Even though when my brother started medication and getting ADHD support their grades improved tremendously and got straight A's They refused support at grade 11 and started failing everything and has gotten to this point They just say I don't know what to do or say I don't see the point And my dad is enabling it my mom always has to be the one to talk to them because of it My mom is tired of it I am fed up with it and want to talk to my dad about it without him getting upset I want my dad to understand where both me and my mom are coming from My brother has yet to talk to me for calling them out and my dad is upset at me I don't want our relationship to be strained but I also want them both to know that their behaviour can't continue How should I bring it up with my dad and my brother about this Any advice is appreciated Thank you for your time EDIT I tried to keep this as vague as possible because I still want to protect my brothers privacy and I still deeply care about my brother and want him to change for the better good But a lot of people misunderstood that as me being resentful jealous and unempathetic So I will add it here that my brother uses ADHD as an excuse to be violently abusive physically and mentally towards me and our mother especially when we try to talk to them about changing their life and what they have done wrong I may have gotten a little too angry while writing this post and may have sounds more not empathetic to my brother But this has gone on for five year since they've graduated high school It just got more worst once they decided to waste their life away and it is affecting my whole family I just need advice on how to approach this with my brother and my dad in a way both of them can understand and change My brother uses ADHD as an excuse despite having all the support,ADHD

893,So this is the first ever time I post on Reddit But honestly I don t know what else to do and I desperately need advice Before I get into my situation I need to give some context I m 20 years old and I own several really successful companies and YouTube channels I ve been doing this since I was 13 but it really took off only when I was around 16 years old Throughout all my life everyone has told me I m an ADHDR I never got diagnosed and never went to the doctors cause my mom doesn t believe it will do me any good if I do get officially diagnosed But all in all I fit the exact ADHD stereotype Constant fidgeting extremly good at making connections between thoughts which gives me an insane advantage in the business I m in But I basically hit all the boxes I never really saw it as a disadvantage But as I grow up I feel like whatever it may be that I have ADHD or something else is starting to get worse Let me explain When I finished high school I dropped out immediately at that point I was already making high 5-6 figures per month and pursuing college was pointless in my opinion Over the last 2-3 years I ve done it all travelling the world exclusive parties meeting celebrities doing extreme sports buying expensive things learning new hobbies and moved to Singapore and Dubai I also have a loving family a wonderful girlfriend and really nice friends and lots of interest My life has honestly been a blessing I still struggle with all the common ADHD things but honestly I ve been able to manage it all somehow But the issue is that over the last few months my adhd or whatever it is that I have is getting worse The conversation in my head never shuts up And even though I really want to do certain things I just can t get out of bed and do them It s almost as if life has become a boring game to me that I ve been speedrunning And recently I ve just been losing myself in to this endless spiral of overthinking It s almost depressing I ve become so good at recognising patterns in my life that I know exactly what comes next and it takes away all the joy For example even though I love my girlfriend a ton I know that we are young and the statistical likeliness of us staying together and her not cheating on me or me not becoming bored or frustrated with her are very high Even though everything is perfect I m already mad sad and frustrated about the things that will in my head most likely happen in the future I m ready to burn it all down It s not only that but life just feels boring It feels like I ve done everything already and I m only 20 I m really sorry if this message was badly formulated or totally weird or not understandable But maybe someone can help me understand what is happening to me I m a 20 year old millionaire and I m bored of life,ADHD

900,Hi I ve just been diagnosed with ADHD I ve also just gone through a breakup I m 25 I was with my girlfriend for 3 years We were still are very much in love but I broke our trust in October so we ve decided to end things She stayed Xmas eve Xmas day and doesn t know how she feels Though she says we need to both move on We were a couple again it felt like intimate emotionally and physically Until the next day after I made her a coffee in bed when she then reminded me of her inevitable departure from our relationship It crushed me and still does She s honestly the love of my life and I would do anything to get her back We aren t in contact and we re both trying to move on However behind closed doors I d marry her in a heartbeat I always just labelled myself as a work in progress an imperfect person who has procrastination issues and self worth self esteem problems Reading about how people with ADHD are in relationships I really am finding it sad that I didn t know sooner I m not using it as an excuse for the way I reacted to us breaking up or as an excuse for bad treatment Overall we were very happy together I m just asking if I should tell her about my diagnosis as it s contributed to a lot of bad decisions my end in the way I dealt with things things I struggled with in the relationship Thanks guys lots of love x Do I tell my ex about my ADHD,ADHD

902,I was previously on concerta which i did and didnt like it helped a lot but the come down was so annoying and i liked it mainly bc i didn t have to take it every day for it to work for me I was recently switched to wellbutrin which i have to take twice a day 150mg after a few weeks i felt like it helped tremendously with organizing my thoughts and being more emotionally put together but i also felt like parts of me and my personality were stripped away It was hard for me to feel my good emotions as deeply i didn t feel as excitable and i felt as if my curiosity and wonderment for life was suppressed and i hated that so much i stopped taking it for a few weeks more and now i feel my true emotions bubbling up as well as the wonderful adhd symptoms has anyone ever had this side effect does anyone know of a medication that may help but not suppress so much of my personality i know not everything effects everyone the same way i am just seeking out other options I really liked the wellbutrin aside from the hallow feeling of my emotions Wellbutrin alternatives,ADHD

904,I'm sure I don't have to explain to this crowd but I have a lot of hobbies and areas of focus I bounce between It's often overwhelming but unavoidable In the 12 months since my diagnosis I've reflected on all my interests hobbies obsessions with a new ADHD perspective One such reflection revealed the discovery that I absolutely hyperfocus on people specifically individuals I'm attracted to This attraction is often plutonic but is sometimes a sexual one Nevertheless I crave contact with that person which I find conflicts with my introspective personality I find excuses to talk to them and often abuse any power I have to connect with them This has sometimes blossomed into beautiful romantic relationships new best friends or I've purposely had to avoid them because it would be unhealthy for both of us I currently don't have anyone I feel I can talk to who would understand this and I fear I would be labeled creepy Hoping others can relate Thanks for reading My hyperfocus is often people,ADHD
905, I am no longer afraid of deadlines and feel immune to pressure building due to time constraints What do I do,ADHD
906,Big rant because I need to pour my heart out Long read that I doubt will get any interaction though if you have a moment to spare I can t say how much I would appreciate some encouragement wisdom or advice I 24f have had one of those days where something I neglected has had a real consequence and sent me into a massive shame spiral I have some pretty bad issues with demand avoidance and I feel so broken and dysfunctional as a human being The neglected something in question is a strange sound my car has been making for ages Today my mom asked to borrow my car and it also hit the breaking point today and sounds worse than ever She s mortified that I ve been ignoring this for so long Why haven t I taken it in to be fixed How does an ADHD person explain to a neurotypical person something so nonsensical I don t know why I didn t deal with this sooner I knew it was a problem I knew continuing to drive it would inevitably cause more damage But the anxiety of paying for the repair caused me to absolutely freeze and ignore this problem for months So my mother was angry and I just broke down into tears Her thoughts are that plenty of people with ADHD function better than I do which is true and I can t just blame things on my ADHD In her words I have ADHD and I m also lazy Being labeled as lazy really bothers me because it s such a shame inducing term I know there s more to it than being lazy though I understand how to any properly functioning person it would look like that I feel like I m trying all the time I would give anything to be different but for whatever reason I feel so so stuck This specific incident aside at 24 I am reckoning with the increasingly apparent consequences of my life-management struggles My relationships have suffered I ve lost important friendships because I can t manage to stay in touch with anyone if I don t see them situationally on a regular basis I ve devastated my reputation among peers because of my impulsive decisions I feel like I have no choice but to forfeit the big dreams and aspirations I had for my future I ve gone back to school for education after years of dreaming and striving to work as an artist I ve conceded to the fact that at this point in my life I don t have the organizational skills required to work as an artist managing a forever fluid schedule on a gig-to-gig basis making time for audition prep and grant-writing to make sure I have said gigs lined up working constantly and somehow managing basic physical needs on top of it all Additionally this arts community is where I ve hurt my reputation and the rejection-sensitivity is too much for me to bare My other dream was to be a psychologist which because of my initial choice to pursue my BFA would be a 5-year endeavour rather than the 2 years it takes to get my teaching degree Practicality wins It always seems to doesn t it I do think I ll be a great teacher am excited for the job and for the financial ability to support myself and pay off my student debt from my first degree and recognize that this isn t forever and I can always return to my art in the future In a way the decision to temporarily leave the arts is freeing though simultaneously my ego has been absolutely crushed I can t help but see this as a failure to achieve the huge potential I was always told and really believed I had I feel like I am losing the biggest most essential part of myself Will I ever get to indulge in that passion again I m heartbroken honestly I understand at this point it is imperative for me to figure out how to keep creativity an active part of my life though I am up against my atrocious time management skills I waste my time away chasing cheap dopamine in stupid things like iPhone games and w33d and while I know what a sacrifice of time this is all turning out be I can t seem to kick my bad habits and create any new more meaningful ones Without art as my career and all of my free time down the drain I don t recognize myself I am so far from living life as the person I want to be I have so many passions and interests that only occupy space in my mind but I can t manage to manifest in my life Ultimately I know so much of what I am struggling with is tied intrinsically to my ADHD but that now just feels like an excuse I use to mask the fact that I am a broken dysfunctional human being I feel pathetic I ve always mediated shame over my shortcomings by focussing on the strengths I do possess but lately those strengths seems utterly void within the structure of our society and I would so readily trade them for more practical skills that would actually get me through life I ve felt in the past that my ADHD was a super power but now it seems to hurt me more than ever I ve never been so insecure I ve never resented myself like this How do I possibly get myself out of this hole I ve dug myself into How do I find the self-discipline to make real change when this discipline is so incredibly foreign to me Okay rant over Thoughts appreciated Dealing with shame and self-hatred over ADHD-related-shortcomings,ADHD
907,Hi Im an international student in Aarhus Denmark I seem to have ADHD and most likely some mild form of OCD too and it s slowly ruining my life I ve never been evaluated by a psychiatrist this is a purely a self diagnosis I would love to get tested and if officialy diagnosed take some type of medication that helps me focus The thing is I don t really know how to get started with this process I ve been in the country for 4 months and I wasn t able to find a lot of information online that s available in English This is why I m inquiring here Is it as simple as going to my GP that I m registered with and asking for a reference Can someone help me Thanks in advance P S I couldn t ask this question in r Denmark too because I don t have enough karma Diagnosis Medication in Denmark,ADHD
908,Just wondering what works for everyone I was diagnosed with ADD inattentive type as a kid Although reading some of the posts and comments in here makes me wonder if I really have it that bad but I legitimately struggle so bad to focus that I still haven't gotten a career started I'm currently not 20 or 30 years old anymore so to an extent I have kind of learned to counteract some natural tendencies But never on this particular problem I'm gonna get into I'm trying to go the self taught self directed from home method web development and uh well I've been at this for years and have not gotten very far at all It doesn't help I've changed my mind on what I'm doing like maybe I should start with IT wait maybe I want cybersecurity etc I've settled for sure on web development though While I did just start medication for this Strattera it will likely take some time to get to a therapeutic dose and in the mean time I really hope I can improve this So far I have tried meditation and setting ADHD music from YouTube on in the background while I go at it And if I'm honest it only helps for about 20 minutes before my brain starts telling me ok I'm having a great time but I'm getting tired already Let's play chess and look up fantasy football stuff to wake us up from this a little bit and you all probably know where that one goes from there This is such an issue that while I have a college degree I only managed that because I scrambled reading cliff notes or whatever I could find at the last minute for 4 years Honestly I might have actually read maybe two books or whatever the whole time I struggled greatly with office jobs too Labor worked for me to make ends meet because it was a bit easier to stay focused when physically exerting but I never really saw that aligning with my actual interests and values sadly Also any other tips would be welcome such as dieting or whatever I usually make pretty healthy choices although I like pizza a lot Organic focusing methods,ADHD
909,i spend a lot of time alone during the year but for the holidays i come home for a week or so several days are spent adjusting to being around others most of the time bc my brain isn't used to it there's irritability and the pressure of gifts and everything else that makes the holidays stressful i'm back at my place now and am finding again that it is difficult to shift back to mostly-alone mode i also struggled a lot with this when i left my job a few months ago going from tons of interaction during the day to very little i have friends locally but people are busy burnt out from the holidays or saving their energy for new years eve i'm having trouble regulating and adjusting to being back old routines etc ik its a weird time of year for everyone but besides listening to podcasts and watching stuff it's hard to occupy the time when i'd rather be hanging out with ppl any ideas for making the adjustment easier and finding simulating social interaction when no one is available adjusting socially during holiday szn,ADHD
910,It is exhausting I have to listen to music and speed walk everywhere or I get bored I have to talk to myself out loud to processs my thoughts I am constantly calculating and harassing myself about my life and a million billion different things Some of them are mean to myself or uncomfortable It is worse when I have time alone with my own mind which I do because I am on break and my friends are in another state Every minute feels like an hour I want something to make it all go quiet I will do any drug I have a plug anyway Coffee does nothing other than make me either tired or nervous I am bored very easily and constantly looking for stimulation and excitement but my life does not have very much I have joined a hundred clubs traveled I am going to Oregon in two days to stay on a farm with strangers and after that I will be in college and this will probably go back to normal once I have people to talk to that I find more interesting than my family but even in college my free time is exhausting I cannot sit in the library and work or go on my phone for three hours every day I keep getting up and walking to target and shopping Multiple times a day To the point that I am incredibly broke This is no way to live I am partially looking for advice but also partially looking for anyone at all that relates to me even to a small defreee because I feel like an alien like I am being tortured by my head and I m the only one who is I can t stop thinking,ADHD

912,I majorly struggle with pulling myself away from screens I get 100 distracted from doing anything else including the hobbies I love It's so easy to lose sense of time when my brain is glued to a screen I think losing that sense of time is the major contributor to getting stuck so I've implemented a strategy that has made a positive impact for me and maybe it will for others too TLDR 1 Create a physical list of activities you want like to do instead of screen time 2 Post the list where you use screens 3 While you're using a screen pick a time or event that will mean it's time to stop and switch to something on the list 4 Set an alarm so you don't forget 5 Make no exceptions when your signal to switch happens amp x200B 1 Create a physical list of activities you want like to do instead of screen time For me this includes Draw build that model kit I bought 2 months ago put clothes in washer review and edit my DSLR pics buy bookcase for living room scoop litter box etc I often forget the things I actually want to spend my time doing so when something comes to mind I add it to the list If I'm not at home I write it in my phone notes so I can add it later seeing the list at home reminds me to do this which brings us to step 2 2 Post the list where you are using screens This improves visibility so accessing the list requires 0 effort I have copies of the list taped on the wall right next to my TV and the wall behind my bed 3 While you're using a screen pick a time or event that will mean it's time to stop and switch to something on the list This is the hard part and will require time before it starts becoming a habit As soon as you realize you're stuck define the signal that means it's time to switch For example when I realize I'm stuck watching YouTube videos I tell myself I can watch 1 more video length of video doesn't matter the point is to give myself control over the situation not to limit myself When I'm playing a mobile game or scrolling social media I see what time it is and pick a time to click the power button on my phone Sometimes I give myself 5 minutes sometimes 30 minutes Eventually I want to get to the point where I define the signal when I start screen use but not quite there yet 4 Set an alarm so you don't forget If your signal is an event set the alarm to when you think the event is going to happen and snooze it if it goes off before the event 5 The most important part is to make no exceptions when your signal to switch comes This is very hard What helps me is to think about how friggin good it will feel to hit that power off button Looking at the list gives me encouragement Don't close the app or exit your Internet browser first just hit the power button It's less steps and instant preventing you from seeing something else shiny and distracting amp x200B If you forget to switch when the signal comes or you make exceptions IT'S OKAY It takes baby steps for sure As long as you're trying you're already rewiring your brain The more you practice the easier it gets I promise Edit Fixed formatting The strategy I use to gain control when I get stuck on my phone computer TV,ADHD
913,This hasn t happened to me ever before but is it common for a medical provider to say don t fill till x day In the past regardless of when I saw my doc they would send in the prescription and the pharmacy would determine if it could be filled aka has it been 30 days I d just a notification on my app that the meds aren t ready to be filled yet on hold I m currently seeing an NP and when I talked to the pharmacist they said she made a note not to fill it until the end of the month So right now nothing is shown on my app bc it s not in To give context the previous month I did ask her to send one of my prescriptions to a different pharmacy bc of the shortage but everything was after my 30 days I can t pick them up right now even though it s over the 30 Days bc of her note Right now the only reason I have meds is because I skip days-I just found it annoying and curious since everything is in the database and it doesn t matter where I send the meds This is regards to controlled meds Medical provider delay prescription,ADHD

917,Hi before Christmas I was still trying to find my therapeutic dose but since I was unable to talk to my psychiatrist I didn t take the meds with me because I was scared at the airport I was travelling to see some family and sometimes you need more than just the prescription and I didn t have that other paper I was at 12 5mg twice a day but it still wasn t high enough for me and I was wondering if I should start at 12 5mg again and keep going until I find what works for me or should I start at 5mg which was the smallest dose I was given to see how my body reacts and then go on I tried to find something on the internet but was unable to and I also tried contacting my psychiatrist to no avail If anyone has any advice it would be wonderful Going back on Ritalin after a break,ADHD
918,Hello everyone I'm a 37-year-old who was diagnosed with ADHD about 8 days ago I was prescribed Methylphenidate specifically Medikinet adult a two-phase extended release preparation available in Germany not the same as Concerta as far as I understand and started taking it the day after my diagnosis So I've been on the medication for a week now I began with 5 mg in the morning and was advised to increase the dose every four days Currently I'm taking 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg at lunchtime So far the effects have been mild not the dramatic day-and-night changes I've heard some people experience However I do feel somewhat less anxious perhaps with a quieter mind less impulsivity and I'm more motivated to engage in activities I want to do I haven't experienced any significant side effects yet Sometimes I wonder if I'm imagining these positive effects but overall I'm satisfied My question is Should I keep increasing the dose What's the average dosage for this drug To be honest I haven't noticed much difference between taking a single 10 mg dose per day and my current dose 10 mg in the morning 5 mg at lunch I plan to discuss this with my psychiatrist but I would also appreciate hearing the opinions of fellow ADHD people Looking forward to your comments amp x200B Adjusting to Methylphenidate,ADHD

936,Hi Some years ago I saw two neurologists over possible epilepsy as I suspected that I was having absence seizures One diagnosed me with the condition while the other was on the fence but prescribed me meds anyway I didn't take the meds due to doubts regarding the diagnosis and not wanting to start anti-seizure meds while in a new job they can cause side effects that may affect job performance However to be on the safe side I gave up on trying to get my driver's license Over the years I've kept wondering if I did the right thing health wise Untreated epilepsy is risky Then I recently thought about the posibilty that I am disassociating accidentally due to ADD HD rather than having absence seizures TLDR I was diagnosed with epilepsy a few years ago but believe that I may be disassociating due to ADD HD instead I would like to hear about the experience of anyone who was diagnosed with epilepsy only to find out that instead of having seizures they were actually disassociating Thanks to all who reply edit added a few words Has anyone here who disassociates due to ADHD been misdiagnosed with Epilepsy ie the disassociation is mistaken for an absence seizure,ADHD
937,Hey yall I m a relatively new to seeking medical intervention for my ADHD primarily inattentive and since I started using medication to treat my symptoms i ve kind of been stuck in a place where i couldn t really take a break from the meds on the weekends since September of this year now that my semester has come to a close i finally have the flexibility to not take them routinely and jesus it feels like my body got accustomed to the boost i can barely get myself out of bed when i can im not even able to complete some basic tasks like laundry my washer and dryer is no more than 5 foot steps away I don t want to be dependent so im gonna continue holding off on using them unless the workload earnestly calls for it it s just a bit hard and i wanted to voice that This Crash Is Kicking My Ass,ADHD
938,It all started with my mower running out of gas and forgetting to go get more until the lawn was super tall I got the keen impression that my neighbors were irritated with me letting it get unkempt and that triggered this really strange anxiety about actually just mowing the dang lawn Like I couldn't let them see me do it I want to have a nice lawn but now I can't because they want me to This isn't the first time I've had experiences like this I have a hard time paying bills once I get a late notice I have garbage cleaning skills because I would get this irrational rage when my parents told me to do chores by the time I was done virtual grad school I didn't even check my final grades because logging on to the portal had become so aversive Pathological Demand Avoidance is one of the things associated with ADHD that I don't hear much about Especially when it follows you into adulthood So I thought it'd be fun to open a discussion where we could laugh at ourselves for the weird things we've refused to do share knowledge advice or just generally support each other Because honestly it does suck and it can be incredibly disruptive but I know there's probably a good handful of us here that struggle with this I barely mowed my lawn for two years because I felt like my neighbors wanted me to,ADHD

959,Hey after a long lurking spree I drew up the courage to post here My background skip if too long for you So like many of you my journey with adhd started at a young age I grew up being in my own world and disrupting classes because I was too quick to finish my assignments Primary school i had good marks despite being a menace to society My parents had me tested but refused to treat me 1990s views on meds smh In high school I became a super quiet and introverted nerd At 18 i joined the military for about 4 years my adversion to authority was once again activated and the military decided it was a great idea to give me more authority In my early 20s i had to take care of my dying mother When she passed I went to college and started to understand that i might have something wrong with me i was putting in the hours but the results were meh with some hints of brilliance That when i decided to seek help i go re-tested and surprise ADHD I was given ritalin and then like it was magic I became this A average student finishing with best of class medal Success story i guess for meds I stopped taking them after i graduated thinking I could join the workforce and perform no problem Well Kinda but my impulses and comorbid anxieties got the better of me I had to reset myself I quit my job and found the best job of my life It's weird it pays well and I feel heard But after being high on the novelty of the new job for 3 month my ADHD started creaping back in I started to procrastinate more and then became super inattentive and impulsive when getting feedback I called up my doc and decided to get back on medication this time adderall because it gives me less side effects Now that I'm feeling better I wanted to try dating again Dating LOL For most of my life I found myself estranged from societal norms I never really dated like others I often created an image in my head of the person i was interested in I would create this fairytale like idea of my crush to the point that it became cripling to me to even ask them out or make a move to advance intimacy Not out of a lack of interest but rather I felt like I had so many inputs being processed by my brain and no being able to hone into my felt emotions I also realized that I suffer from Rejection Sensitive Dysforia i believe its trauma based I was rejected by a girl in primary school in front of the whole class in a very dramatic manner I also had a 3 year long friendzone relationship in my head that didn't do me any good I had few intimate encounters and close to no medium to long-term relationships as I mostly ended things as i lost interest in my crushes I have a BDSM porn addiction I think i enjoy some aspects of it like shibari but I also believe I got into it because normal porn became to boring I think daily consumption is also causing me to no be great in the bed room In the bed room I am not in the moment I get it up for a bit and then it drops as I lose focus It's not easy to explain this to a new partner Today I find myself feeling desensitized by dating I am on the dating apps i pay sometimes to get better matches and rarely go on dates When i do I find myself info dumping not understanding any cues from my date and not acting on my impulses to advance things intimately I am worried about rejection and my bedroom performance before we even get there I never go in for a kiss and gove out an uninterested vibe not my intention at all I also seem to feel attraction for a woman one second and not the next My way forward I read Models by Mark Manson Great book and recommend it to anyone trying to date in the modern age I will be taking the advice shared by the book to continue my dating journey Learn to be vulnerable Engage in activities that i am passionate about and meet people there go to therapy for dating exercise reduce my porn consumption walk tall and with confidence Maintain eye contact All of these things are great but they are general advice and I would love to know how you might have dealt with dating and what adhd specific advice you can give me I'd also love to hear your journey Dating with ADHD kinda sucks 32M,ADHD

966,I've been on adderall for about 6 years had been on concerta for long time and switched only due to health insurance My doctor just switched me to vyvanse and I'm wondering about weight loss I had adderall weight boomerang lost 20-30 in first year then have gained 50 and counting over the following years I lost weight on concerta when I started it then tapered off of course Will the switch to vyvanse cause some initial weight loss to kick in I'm not trying to abuse it but I'm not going to lie I'm pretty mad at everything adderall did to me had some other side effects that went undiagnosed the whole time and are reason why I'm switching and I'm worried my metabolism is f'd and if I will just keep gaining weight I know theres more to it than appetite suppression as it changes metabolism some too I'm just not sure if going from one med to another right away will not change anything versus like when I took Concerta was off it for a few years before going on adderall and then my weight loss started Seems like need to rid the bod of it so it's not longer used to it But I'm not a doctor so I see that vyvanse is also prescribed for binge eating which may be perfect because I totally do that too Switching from Adderall to Vyvanse,ADHD

971,My ADHD is very well controlled with concerta only 36mg but even such a small dose makes it nearly impossible for my appetite to kick in Sometimes I go days on apples and yogurt alone without even noticing I also find it hard to sleep until very late 1-2am I actually feel my concentration wearing off around 5pm but obviously the meds are still in my bloodstream so I m still feeling other effects Anyone have any tips for remembering to eat and sleeping more effectively Tips for eating sleeping with Concerta,ADHD

973,In case this helps anyone in the same situation I ve had a bad problem for years of using up my meds early I worked with my provider extensively to no avail The reality of it was I needed my meds dosed out to me and to not have access to the whole month s script But I live alone am single and have no friends or family nearby There s nobody who could dose out my meds to me daily The solution I ve been using successfully for gt 6 months is to use a pill safe and put the keys to it in a safety deposit box at a bank that is 15 min drive to get to The e-pill brand safe I use is very tamper proof It dispenses my meds automatically once a day There s no way for me to get to the rest of my script short of me driving to the bank when it s open to get the keys from the safety deposit box or destroying the pill safe with power tools Tamper-proof automatic dispensing pill vaults are a niche item for sure It s 600 which immediately will turn lots of folks off to this solution My problem has had huge negative impact on me for years so the price for me was worth it e-Pill Safe Highly Tamper https www amazon com dp B00NUETDMY Side note if you re struggling with using up meds early I encourage you to work with your provider on it sooner rather than later The problem will likely only worsen over time I d already been taking stimulant meds for 7 years before I started taking an extra occasionally and the problem got progressively worse over several years My provider was super-helpful and didn t cut off my meds which was my absolute worst fear because I ve been on stimulant meds 15 years and unfortunately am very dependent on them As long as you aren t getting more meds illegally but are just using up your script early I think most providers will work with you and not cut off your meds If you live alone and use up meds early,ADHD

982,Hi everyone I've been analyzing a few of my behaviors and have noticed a peculiar pattern when I'm playing games with others tabletop but could be video games too Firstly I need people to play by the rules if it's written in the leaflet it needs to be played this way If people change the rules I get overly frustrated by that but I don't really know why I care so much Secondly I take playing WAY too seriously it is almost like my life is on the line I can get upset pushy or get angry at people who do not take the game as seriously as I do which is a problem in a social setting where the game is just a pretext to be together I literally start moving other players pawns so the game goes faster Thirdly I've always been a sore looser I can't stand loosing it's just not fun at all I'm unable to play just to have fun and enjoy the time around people I've thought about it and figured it could be linked to ADHD 1 justice sensitivity changing the rules means changing the game's balance which could impact a player's chances to win a game especially if that player is myself 2 playing the game just gives me dopamine I hyperfocus on it and if people are not playing along stalling making jokes playing dumb moves on purpose I get frustrated as if you were taking away my drug 3 extension of number 2 not winning just results in a dopamine crash instead of a high which makes me really upset Do you guys also feel the same way when playing games Were you able to manage your emotions to just enjoy that time with friends Playing games as an ADHDer,ADHD

984,Just need to get this out of me maybe get some empathy like the flair says Too many emotions I had an interaction with my parents over Christmas that is eating at me and I can't talk to them about it It was a brief moment in a chaotic conversation but I can't get it out of my head Somehow my ADHD came up over dinner I mentioned it causing me to struggle in school and my dad was like that's not how that works while my mom said something along the lines of no it was because you were taking higher level classes I was a gifted kid back when I was in school I took higher level classes as soon as I could I ended my freshman year ranked 2nd in my class As high school went on I started to struggle more and more with keeping up with homework and readings and even retaining information My grades were still considered good but they seriously dropped I had to drop one of my AP classes at one point because the teaching style was not working with my brain and I was failing I switched to the honors version of the class and literally had like a 99 the whole rest of the year in the same subject It was a really frustrating and painful decline for me and not a single adult in my life said anything to me other than to try harder or asked if I was ok I wasn't ok I could tell something was really wrong with me but no matter what I did I couldn't get my brain to work again I cried a lot I felt like a huge disappointment and embarrassment I was exhausted I went from number 2 to failing classes and nobody was concerned I just needed to try harder or whatever In LATE college I figured out I probably had ADHD from being around a lot of people who had it and I was able to get a diagnosis I didn't get meds until a couple years later but they absolutely changed my life My brain mostly works again There's so much I can do and focus on that I couldn't before Which reminds me now as I type this how my ADHD came up I was talking about how ADHD meds have made me absolutely love cleaning where it used to be a painful impossible task and the way my parents treated chores in our house growing up didn't help My dad said something along the lines of woah where was this when you lived here and I was kind of just stunned For one it felt very selfish of him but mostly I was deeply upset by the fact that his negligence is part of why I suffered for so long Of course my parents DO NOT understand that I suffered much less how bad it was It was all the more frustrating because I was one of those kids where there was really clearly SOMETHING going on that wasn't right but because I was smart nobody did anything I hold a lot of resentment about it that I know I need to work through with a therapist but hearing my parents talk this way about things they don't understand and refuse to and caused me so much hurt over the years kind of made me feel sick I wasn't able to get much in in response to them other than well I'm talking about MY experience and I'm sure they've already forgotten about the interaction But I can't stop thinking about it and feeling sick to my stomach There's so much else I need to say about this but I can't get my words further organized adding to my frustrations If you read this far thank you I really needed to just Get this off my chest in some way I know there's not really any resolution here but writing it out helped a little Not enough but it's something Tldr i was shocked and frustrated by my parents lack of understanding of both adhd and the ways i hurt and suffered in school Interaction with my parents about my adhd has me frustrated,ADHD

986,Before I say anything yes I know that different meds work differently on every person I m just posting in this in hopes of maybe getting a little more direction in my research and what to bring up when I talk with my doctor about my meds On top of ADHD I also have autism both diagnosed when I was 18 I am now 20F initially my Dr started me on Dexedrine I was taking 10mg daily My heart definitely felt it but not my brain if that makes sense I could take 20mg and easily take a 3 hour nap after We then decided to stop the dexedrine and try Vyvanse 30mg I am also on and have been on fluoxetine for quite a while Apperantly those two are supposed to work really well together Honestly it helped a little but not a significant amount We then tried adding Ritalin short release 10mg helped a little more but still not significantly After a few months I didn t really notice much happening so my Dr decided to up my Vyvanse to 60mg Which still wasn t even a drastic change It worked for about a month and then just stopped This will sound bad but when I really need to have a grind study session I can take up to 180mg just to get that focus effect that people seem to get on a normal dose What I can say though is that Vyvanse does have an affect on my energy and mood Fluoxetine works well for my anxiety but I find that the Vyvanse is much better at helping with my mood not so much my focus though I am starting to get really lost on what to do I am studying neuroscience and as topics start to get harder I really start to notice the barrier that my ADHD puts between my peers and I I don t know if it s the autism that is making these meds not work for me I know all the rules about no Vit c within a few hours of taking the meds make sure to sleep protein and all that but it really is just not working and I don t know what to do what med s actually have worked for you,ADHD

1014,I m not a fan of physical contact It makes me uncomfortable Especially hugs My friends are all aware of and acknowledge this and it is a boundary they are all comfortable with not crossing When it s just us we have no issues with it When I feel comfortable with a particular person I sometimes initiate physical contact such as leaning into them This is only enjoyable if I initiate it though However I have found that when in a somewhat public space where other people strangers can see us they always automatically go back into the social norm expectation of giving hugs to say goodbye I feel like this is more of an I don t know how to say goodbye in a non-awkward way that a isn t hugging kind of thing though because tbf goodbyes are awkward especially when you may feel judged for being rude and just leaving I get it Still kinda sucks tho They always say the line I know you don t like hugs but I m gonna give you one anyway Weirdly stuck with me coz it makes me feel conflicted It s meant more as a warning to prepare me for the hug ig and to identify the action as affectionate and caring for my feelings But it really just makes it feel a bit worse because they re showing they re aware of my boundaries and what makes me uncomfortable but are choosing to cross them and make me uncomfortable anyway Idk The automatic safe social response is relatable masking sucks glad I stopped forcing that But man I wish they wouldn t Just makes it harder to talk about my aversion to hugs now because they might feel offended now they know they re included in the list of people that hug me anyway There go my boundaries Ah hello uncomfortableness Anyone else experience this You ever been given the line I know you don t like hugs but I m gonna give you one anyway,autism
1015,I know this sounds a little stupid to ask but sometimes I am able to read a persons expression pretty well nowadays especially if I know them very well basically if they are a close family member I believe I have acquired this ability by asking those I know what they are feeling at a certain time and making a note of what I see on their face It took years to master but now I m quite good at it for the basic emotions sad angry happy but struggle when the situation becomes more complex This skill took me years to master but it started me thinking Is it normal to acquire this skill and get better at reading emotions as an adult I see some autistic people saying they have no clue what someone is feeling even as an adult and others who say they mastered it at a young age I still feel like I lean more towards not getting expressions if I m honest Is it normal for an autistic person to be able to learn the facial expressions of family members,autism

1021,Hi Ive had an autism and ADHD diagnosis since I was at least four I'm 24 now My mother helped me a lot but passed away a few years ago My father doesn't understand my world perspective at all and just thinks I'm a lazy useless piece of shit he doesn't get it at all His idea of helping me is forcing me to do things that cause me severe distress and pushing me into working jobs I hate that make me even more depressed that I work at for six months then quit because I've become so overwhelmed and upset by everything that it usually results in me having a meltdown at work quitting living off the few thousand I've saved for a few months then scraping by till I'm forced to go and do that again No matter how much I explain he doesn't understand it one bit he thinks I can just function like everyone else He thinks I live in the same universe as everyone else yet I don't and expects so much of me and yet when I explain what I want to do its as if he misinterprets it entirely or just either doesn't really give a shit about me and how I feel and just often tells me to shut up or stop being so angry when I'm clearly in distress or very overwhelmed and it hurts I can barely function most days I have no energy I constantly wake up feeling sick I eat maybe once a day because even cooking anything is stressful for me and very overwhelming I get stressed so easily He doesn't understand I can't even function around people he tells me off all the time for getting overwhelmed and stressed out I'm constantly on the edge of just flipping out in a red hot rage and destroying everything He is all I have in my life apart from one close friend in my life who is very dear to me but even sometimes I push her away with how angry and constantly tense and overwhelmed I feel I feel like I have to be constantly stoned or really drunk to just function and relax and not be angry overwhelmed feeling tense all over and I can't even relax because I don't know how to I feel like in general if I'm not stoned or drunk I'm just one stone throw away from having an autistic meltdown and smashing everything in sight and breaking down and crying combined with a huge panic attack I don't even have shit in my life I've been nothing and feeling like I'm going to end up homeless at this rate eventually and if I ever manage to make friends apart from my one close friend in my life they just backstab me or take advantage of me because I'm incapable of reading if people are actually my friends or just trying to use me for their own gain which has happened so many times I've tried so many times to explain to my father whats going on in my life and head but he doesn't get it and I live in Western Australia Its an okay country but there is no opportunities for me to even do what I can actually handle and am good at for a career I've been attempting freelance art and graphics but there is no industry here and its basically a non-existent industry here but its all I can handle because I get too anxious around other people and feel extremely uncomfortable and I'm just borderline ready to have a meltdown I just want to leave this country to maybe Canada or Europe go to a good college develop my skills even further and maybe even people talking skills improve my knowledge and make something for myself and make a life of my own but I'm so trapped due to my autism due to this country and my inability to even look after myself I do at least have a drivers license I guess at least I did attempt a boilermaking apprentice for 11 months to try and do something but quit that due to coworkers making me extremely uncomfortable and getting verbally abused because its just how it is for apprentices in trades and constantly getting abused and called lazy for wanting to take a minute of my own time to calm down when I began to feel overwhelmed or constantly told I'm making excuses But in the end I would never touch a heavy industry job again as it was very overwhelming very loud and slid me further into a spiral especially after getting assaulted there I'm sorry to introduce myself like this but discovering this subreddit I really only just lurk as I have troubles in communicating has been very eye opening for me to see the fact I'm not alone But I feel so trapped and helpless here I just want to escape to somewhere better where I can focus on myself and be happy and pursue myself a career at what I'm passionate in and stop relying on weed to help me function somewhat normally relax and not be in constant pain from my muscles constantly being tense because when I'm not stoned I'm like this aggressive rage beast that is just stuck in constant distress from all the pain in my joints my mental pain and feeling overwhelmed incredibly easy I'm so tired of it all I do also suffer from major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder and have my entire life for those of you wondering I was on just an ever changing list off SSRI's and anti-anxiety medications and ADHD medications from age eight to 20 but they made me incredibly unstable and especially the SSRI's making me extremely suicidal in my late teens I went off them in the end due to how badly I suffered from side effects and the fact they made my mental health way way worse I just feel so trapped in Australia I have no opportunities for myself here to do what I'm passionate and talented in and the only person that was there for me and really truly understood me has been dead since 2020 I try everyday to pretend I'm okay and everything is fine when In reality I feel like I'm in constant mental Hell pretending I'm a totally normal person when internally I'm suffering so much Stuck in a country where there is nothing for me barely anyone in my life and no way out for me to even get close to achieving what actually makes me happy I love creating grahics animated graphics and I know I have a talent at it and I love doing art creating drawing and painting because I can just sit for 12 hours with my headphones on listening to the same few albums I will only listen to over and over again been in my little world totally at peace with myself and happy and working my ass off on my own little projects ignorant to time food and sleep and its just so satisfying for me to do that Thank you for listening to my longarse rant Any support or advice is appreciated I just feel like I'm fucked and stuck in this hot ass deadend country with no way of escaping it or doing anything with my life Please don't hate me I feel trapped and I'm always angry no matter what,autism
1022,As an autistic person I have always been a bit scared and anxious about change I ve always stuck to somewhat of a routine and when something happens that s unexpected or new I can shut down and not take it well For more context about this whole situation about a month ago I got into a heated argument with my step grandma who happens to own my parents home and was told I only had a month to find a place to live that wasn t there My family hasn t been very supportive and didn t even try to get it to where I was allowed to stay I was simply just made to deal with it Luckily I have my boyfriend and I have been able to find an apartment with him that is a reasonable price The anxiety about finding a place is gone but it s been replaced with extreme anxiety about moving my living space I have always felt the need to try and take control of a situation so I can better control the outcome but I feel like it s kind of consuming me I found out not too long ago that we were approved for the apartment and all I can think about is getting everything prepared and ready but my boyfriend is taking things a lot slower than me and it s kind of making me upset Thankfully his family is able to help us all out with the move and is even willing to give us things and help us buy stuff we need Due to this he is a lot less worried than I am and I think he s having trouble seeing where I m coming from when I talk about how anxious I am He has been very reassuring and all that but change is still a very scary thing for me and we are both still pretty young I m 19 and my boyfriend is 21 Any advice on how to get through the anxiety Moving into my first apartment and I m extremely nervous,autism

1024,Over the course of my life I've had very few friends the only ones I've had that I consider friendships were long lasting longest 7 years shortest 2 years and deep but eventually end in a heartbreaking way A lot of the time I end up either expressing how I really feel if they've been hurting me and the friendship ends in a huge fight Other times if I feel uncomfortable with how they've been acting I cut them off to avoid hostility Once I have in mind im cutting them off I no longer feel the need to rekindle the friendship even if they wish It sucks because I don't really want to break off long lasting friendships over a couple small things but once it gets to me I can't stand the person I once loved before which means the friendship was bound to end soon on my accord After these friendships there's a pattern of me having no friends not including online and low maintenance friends or anyone that doesn't know me much and vice versa for a couple of years before the cycle starts again I've tried hard to insert myself in social settings be willing to hangout to get to know someone or a group of people but ultimately I seem to be pushed away or disregarded One of the reasons probably being these people already have close friends and are in no need for another plus I think there's some unspoken rule of not making it too obvious you're trying to be friends with someone or a group I thought it was a middleschool thing to feel like this but as I get older I think that's just how social life is and it isn't made for me I do want friends I just end up always screwing it up It's hard for me to keep make friends,autism

1040,Hey guys I work as a graphic designer at an art center I basically make promotional content and ads both printed and digitally for the art center and its events Lately due to how slow business has been due to the holidays I haven t had a lot of work to do and the work I have been given has already been done and approved Now don t get me wrong as an anxiously vigilant person I m always looking things that need to be done and asking my coworkers and my boss if they need anything from me A lot of the time they don t This just goes to show how efficient I am in getting work done in a timely manner As an autistic person I do have a special interest in cartoons and I do sketch and make art of my own original characters on my free time My boss called me out earlier today about it and said it wasn t appropriate for work mind you it was sfw art and used the same reasoning every manager or boss uses I could get in trouble Which by now I know is just a manipulative tactic corporate leaders use to guilt shame workers into doing or not doing something The only logic that made a little sense to me was the part about using company equipment I use the same computer and software that I use to do my work to make my personal art too for personal reasons And he also mentioned that it s discouraging to him when he s sees me doodling Now I ll admit I don t have that hustle mentality that the American work culture promotes I believe that once I m done the work I was given and if everyone communicates that they don t need my help for anything shouldn t have to sit around for hours bored I ll make the most of my time by doing something positive and constructive which for me is refining my craft Especially if I ve already communicated what I ve completed and what I need on everyone else s part which was confirmed already The reason I don t see it as a big deal is because this is an art center that I work for I could probably understand if this was a different industry but it s to my understanding that art is suppose to be encouraged here Yeah there s other work that needs to get done but that s more so due later in Spring just so yall know how ahead of my work I am but I can t start on that until everyone has done their part again already notified my boss of what s needed So I guess I m just wondering if it s that bad that I doodle on my free time at work Am I in the wrong or is this just another case of American work culture and autism just not mixing well together For context my job is basically to sit in front of the computer and make art anyways EDIT I should ve elaborated more on the convo After i asked him about what I could be doing he gave me a vague answer He said I don t know Make more spring flyers or something For context I knew he was referring to making content to advertise for our spring events but I don t know if he realized our marketing specialist already has everything she needs to be designed So basically that didn t help Autistic Workplace Drama Am I in the Wrong,autism

1042,My child m-15 has an issue with clothes I'm not talking sensory-we have climbed that mountain I'm talking about the clothes that past the tests and need to be worn We have a system where we set up clothes for the week in an open front hanging thing so there's outfits available It kind of works for what we are trying it for The problem is the rest of the clothes It seems like when we put them in a dresser they get forgotten about and they never see the light of day Then you go in and the floor is filled with clothes that don't fit or failed the sensory test and all of his good clothes are sitting in a drawer never to see the light of day His room unfortunately doesn't have a closet but I'd invest in a hanging rolling rack if I thought it would help I'm just curious how others do it Do you just live out of baskets Hang them up because if you can see it you wear it Do you do something on the outside of your dresser drawers I'll take any tips tricks that have worked for you or didn't work What do you do with your clothing in to make it easier to see use wear,autism
1043,For me I get absolutely triggered whenever I'm trying to clean the kitchen and someone comes in and gets a cup of water I have no idea why it just makes me angry What are small things that gets you a little mad,autism
1044,So discovering my autism has been a fairly recent thing in my life I have been going through a journey of understanding and identifying my triggers and such and it has really helped me to understand myself better and why I have always been different from others especially during my high school years My girlfriend has been extremely understanding and supportive of me and can relate to some things she has ADHD However the issue arises with my parents and in particular my dad They have been very supportive and mostly understanding my mom much more so but I feel like they almost disregard my requests when I tell them about my triggers My dad especially will say he understands that I don't want him saying certain stuff but than continue saying that stuff a few days later after he has forgotten Whenever I ask him to adhere to my ticks and not do certain things he always says he will and then flips it on me about how there is stuff I need to work on too Like I get it I got to do certain stuff better or whatever but we aren't talking about how act right now we are talking about you so why are you bringing it up in this moment It just makes me mad Not only that but my dad CONSTANTLY uses phrases like come on you understand Blank or Why are you getting so worked up over Blank or you control the conversation like a fascist the latter of which is a half-joke but still makes me feel like shit And when I try to tell him in the moment that I hate when he talks like that he gets annoyed and rolls his eyes saying WELL The absolute worst part is how my dad encourages me to talk to him about the things that bug me That would be fine if he ACTUALLLY LISTENED to my qualms and changed But I have gotten to the point where I rarely voice my complaints in that aspect as it wont change it's been years of me trying this and there is no point in me trying to talk to a brick wall I really don't known what to do as it is seriously getting to me and there seems to be nothing I can do to stop this I really dont know what to do anymore so if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated Feeling like my dad doesn't listen to me,autism
1045,As in romanticized I mean you had a image that people with autism were really smart and mysterious like they had special powers or ablities or something I know it sounds strange and completely stupid But I had an eye opener when I got diagnosed myself Like okay this is it That s a bummer haha As someone late diagnosed did you previously have a romanticized version of what autism was really like until you got diagnosed yourself,autism
1046,I 21M am currently looking for work and have been for 4 months but i have unable to find a job I got called for 1 interview but that's it So I reached out to employment services in my area for help One of the things they suggested was removing that I have autism from my resume and not mention it to employers at all until i have been hired I require multiple accommodations to work some that I would need on my first day I feel like it is lying to not mention it and could cause further issues especially if I walk in first day and immediately start requesting accommodations that weren't mentioned in the interview As well I'm not super comfortable working for someone who wouldn't hire an autistic person But i need a job soon I won't be able to pay rent or eat if I don't find a job this month So when should I be disclosing this to employers When is the right time to disclose your autism to an employer,autism

1049,A lot of people commented that they loved the look wished they could pull it off etc etc etc something I loved about the face reveal trend is that I felt so comfortable and loved seeing the range of looks people with autism have and how all of us are gorgeous cuties who generally had to push ourselves to share what we shared I can t tell yall how many people tell me that they ve always wanted to do their hair like mine but couldn t pull it off I know that a lot of us want to blend in rather than stand out but I just want to tell yall that you can rock anything you want to rock as long as it makes YOU feel good If that s super bright hair a unique haircut a fancy outfit painting your nails a different shoe style ANYTHING if it makes you feel good you WILL rock it Do any of you have any examples of this you can share Something you love d so you went for it and your love of it meant you rocked it Any tips or advice for people who have always wanted to do try x but feel like they could never get away with it I want us to have a space to share positivity here but I don t think I m alone when I say I hate toxic positivity so if you want to share a negative experience with this please feel free to and hopefully this awesome community can come together to hype you up if you re open about it I refuse to conform to neurotypical standards I understand that s not possible at ALL times or for ALL autistic people but let s talk about it Sending you all a bunch of love Happy new year Tried to hop on the face drop but post got taken down because the rules changed I was the person with all blue hair eyebrows and lipstick and wanted to start a discussion about self expression,autism

1056,Full disclosure I am not a member of this subreddit I am posting here because I believe the app I've developed could be useful to you guys To adhere to the rules of this subreddit I will not post any links or mention my app's name If you believe an app like this could benefit you please DM me so we can discuss it further Currently the app is invitation-only and we have a limited number of slots available What does the app do Allows you to schedule chores and expenses either as one-time or recurring tasks Enables you to assign chores and expenses to one or multiple people Offers sorting of chores and expenses by color tag or list Sends automatic reminders to everyone assigned to a chore or expense Tracks progress made on chores and expenses Provides a feature to create shopping lists Includes group chats for communication within the app Why I created this app I developed this app shortly after graduating from college It was specifically designed to assist college students like me in splitting chores and expenses with roommates a need I personally experienced After struggling to get my roommates to remember their chores and finding no suitable apps for this purpose I spent a few months developing what I believe is a superior option to any other app currently available Hey everyone I made an app to help you do your chores,autism
1057,I know this doesn't seem very relevant to the subredddit but hold on Also a general warning for me talking about sensory problems involving teeth Makes me squeamish to even think about and I know its not an uncommon sensory ick I am 18 I haven't seen a dentist in a few years my teeth are bad Before you get upset that I haven't gone in years I was put into state custody for neglect And the state also didn't help me or push me to get my teeth fixed I've always had issues with anything touching my teeth especially in a dental sense I've never been able to use electric toothbrushes and HATE almost every single tool used at the dentist Especially the scraping The scraping is very much the worst part of it The only thing I don't mind is the water And to understand how bad this is for me sometimes just the vibration in my teeth from talking can make me feel sick I hate X-rays for the feeling I hate cleanings and im horrified of getting teeth pulled or similar The only thing I've made peace with is novacaine shots because I've been slowly growing out of my needle phobia The lights and cold atmosphere freaks me out in the same way hospitals do for some people me too obv And its not exactly a fostering environment for someone with light sensitivity and chronic migraines either My parents ALSO did not help my anxiety as a child and on several occasions have lied to me about what I needed done They were trying to help but it made things worse for me in the long run I am now going alone and it doesn't feel any less scary Im still afraid of dentists themselves and I've had very poor luck in dentists that accept state insurance I cannot afford to pay out of pocket Yay America I've had some horribly judgemental and mean dentists and have been told over and over again that I am being difficult Usually followed up by using dentist scare tactics or whatever you'd call the berating you get I know the importance of dental care That is a part of my anxiety They don't really understand that I'm typically crying throughout the entire experience and even in waiting rooms I'm undiagnosed sorry to be that person so telling them that I believe im autistic isn't an option medically Dental care is one of the main reasons im seeking a proper legal diagnosis despite knowing I cannot afford it I made my first appointment in years this monday and I'm freaking out about it But i absolutely NEED to go or I could end up with everyday pain instead of every few days Like i said I understand the importance of keeping your teeth healthy so I'd appreciate if that wasn't regurgitated back to me too much The judgement and shame around tooth problems is also a factor in this Im kind of asking for advice moreso for support from people who might have the same experience I don't think any amount of advice will make my anxiety go away since a lot of it is about the sensory experience of the dentist with a side of phobia But any tips or just solidarity might help me Sorry for the long post I hope y'all understand where I'm coming from dental anxiety,autism
1058,I've been wondering if I have autism for a while now and a lot of the experiences that people talk about on here resonate with me a lot but one thing that keeps making me doubt if I have it is that that a lot of stuff that used to make me crazy just doesn't bother me anymore For example I had a huge problem with precisely following game rules to the point where I sometimes started crying if we didn't or not having a thought out plan when going out but nowadays those don't bother me at all because I think I realized how trivial it is to worry about these things if l'm the only one in a group who cares about them The reason this bothers me is that I have an autistic friend who is always annoyed by these things and they remind me of myself from my early teens when I acted the exact same way And it doesn't seem like they're used to it since they react the same way every time even after I try to explain to them that for some reason no one else cares so it's best to just not worry about it yourself So I'm wondering if it's masking or something like that or if I'm really just not autistic Can an autistic person get used to normal behavior,autism

1067,I ve started seeing a psychologist mostly for my anxiety We d had 1 session that went really well Had a lot of insigtful conversations on the root causes of my anxiety mostly being attributed back to my home life as well as my autism I ve always struggled with anxiety of not fitting in especially going to private catholic schools and being treated awfully for being different It s caused me to become paranoid in situations where I could be seen as different I get anxious over basically any social situations that I m not familiar and already comforable and accustomed with Anyway we had been talking and it started going downhill a bit when he first said that to others me being autistic is like being an alien and that s how I m seen Sure I can acknowledge that I am different but I feel like a psychologist should not be calling someone an alien and just actively calling them different like that especially when they already have discussed having anxiety specifically due to that He then started saying he d like to coach me into acting normal saying that by treating my autism it could be the cure to a lot of my anxiety Was discussing empathy and my inability to truely empathise with someone and was going over scenarios and quizzing me on how I should act and such and it just felt very uncomfortable for me He kept bringing up me mentioning that I don t feel upset when I think about my dog passing a few years ago and going on about how I need to pretend and act like I feel the sadness when I remember it It feels like half the session was him just trying to train me not to be autistic I have another appointment with him in a month and I just don t know how to feel Psychologist right or wrongv,autism

1069,For the longest I thought I was only introverted until I started to relate to other people's posts about alienation and masking I also have often gotten people telling me that it's like I'm from another planet At my current work center I've been here around 2 years and I observe everyone else getting along with each other inviting others out after work except me and I noticed this same thing in my previous job as well People can sense something is off with me and it creates this weird energy that I can feel For instance all the alcohol drinkers suddenly don't drink like that anymore or I don't go out like that when they are around me I know for most of them this is a lie and people seem to code switch when they are around me I know the more relatable you are the less difficulty you will have getting genuine versions of people I don't have an official diagnosis but I have related to a lot of the posts here when it comes to being alienated from people who seem to just get it extremely introverted or autism,autism

1071,I'm not sure what category this qualifies as But here is a bit of context for my situation I am a 31 year old neurodivergant guy who lives on my own in my own apartment I've lived in this apartment for about 4 years now and I haven't had any trouble with my neighbors for the most part up until recently These last few weeks or so I've had these a-hole neighbors who have been blasting this god awful music at ungodly hours of the night early morning 12am 5am I have reported them on a few occasions now and nothing has been done The music comes through my bedroom wall and my neighbors on the other side of the wall have been blasting said music for context They also blast their nasty loud music at random hours during the day as well and it is so bad it shakes my whole apartment Me being a neurodivergant person on the spectrum who had PTSD and anxiety as well as being autistic as well Loud noises and things bother me and they trigger my fight or flight mode mostly my flight mode because I don't do confrontation I have also have tried leaving a note on their door which seemed to work for a bit HOWEVER they started right back up with their BS and nonsense with the loud crappy music banging and vibrating thru my bedroom wall The reason I'm posting this is because I'm about at my wits end if not close I have been talking to my therapist about this issue as well and they have been trying to help me as best they can we even talked about moving into the senior building of my apartment building or somewhere else in my state due to my sensory issues I don't know if this is a possibility or simply changing apartments I'm just saying these are things I've been considering because my mental health has been in the bloody toilet since these neighbors moved in Has anyone done anything similar or had to move because of being overstimulated overwhelmed from being in their current apartment house residense due to said sensory issues Or anything similar that might fit this area Any suggestions or insights are welcome thanks for reading Trouble with Neighbors Noise issues Overstimulation,autism
1072,I expected to be diagnosed with autism because basically everything about me fits with autism People who meet me automatically assume I have autism and my whole family has always thought so as well Multiple times I'll relate to a character only to find out later they have autism I've always been considered weird and socially awkward ever since I was a kid I'm pretty decent at socializing my family thinks otherwise and I do it a lot but in an awkward way I have sensory issues I stim frequently have a weird demeanor etc Our meeting lasted about an hour and she concluded that I don't seem to have autism because I'm good at socializing Multiple times in the meeting I explained to her habits that align with autism and she didn't pick up on any of them I was excited to have this meeting so I could be diagnosed with autism and I wouldn't have to wonder why I'm so different but now I'm not so sure if I even have it Autism is something I heavily related to and is a big part of me so being told I don't have it kinda bums me out I went to get professionally diagnosed with autism for sure thinking I'd be diagnosed but I wasn't,autism

1076,53yo WM in US I have a complicated history with child abuse and other trauma that caused me to not ask this question about myself until very recently because I never quite saw the correlation Just before the holidays my mother 73yo WF was asking me why I do and don't do things in certain ways She offered her solutions which usually start with just do thing and she could not understand my answers when I said that thing doesn't work for me that my brain doesn't work that way I then had an interaction with a relative I hadn't seen in a long time and my internal emotional response was clearly not in line with normative expectations and I suddenly asked the question So for the first time I dove into researching ASD and its hallmarks and found confirmation after confirmation My odd sense of humour my masking behaviours my social awkwardness and challenges my ability to spend massive amounts of time alone without feeling lonely or needing human interaction my internal emotional landscape esp surrounding other people the way I see the world and respond to stimuli how I'm very easily overstimulated the massive upset I experience when my routine is changed without my consent etc It all aligns I had a session with my counselor of 9 years yesterday and he laughed out loud in a very kind way we have a great client-therapist relationship when I explained how I didn't like most of the autism evaluation tests I found online because they asked for black and white answers to nuanced concepts he said he's known multiple people with autism who all said exactly the same thing about those tests So without any sort of professional evaluation which I will likely seek out I am becoming convinced that I have ASD I looked at the faq for this sub and saw the levels I'm a level 1 I have a professional career am highly intelligent can usually navigate society without too much trouble if I play the expected role though I had to learn how to do this over a long time with a lot of trial and error but I have a lot of internal challenges happening that no one else knows about It honestly feels a bit fraudulent to say I am autistic without an official diagnosis but based on that assumption I'm looking for some resources to help me navigate this possibility I don't really feel like there is anything wrong with me per se but I would like to better understand how to interface with the world as an autist I also really don't even know the right questions to be asking at this point Any help with navigating this is appreciated Am I autistic Look for some direction resources,autism

1078,I'm really frustrated with my personal mourning process in which I can't cry For context I've been training a service dog with the help of an organization for a year and three months now see PFP and recently my poor girl was traumatized by an incident where a homeless person attacked us I'm not here to bash that person they were mentally unwell and we escaped physically unharmed Unfortunately the situation has left my dog unable to work at all She's terrified and completely incapable of doing her job now We've trainers myself and my dog put in the work to try and fix it but she's not happy doing the job She's constantly looking for the next threat and a service dog who has PTSD can't actually help someone with CPTSD autism and ADHD The trainers and I have choice to wash her from service work because she's not happy doing the job Here's where I'm struggling I'm absolutely heartbroken and completely destroyed but I haven't once cried I honestly don't think I've cried since I was a child except during massive meltdowns and usually I'm more screaming than crying I feel like I should be crying I WANT to cry I'll get to a point that I feel like I will I never get past that People around me always question why I don't cry over big tragedies I've always said I just don't but this one's really making me question it because it's one of three losses in my life I've felt like this with I didn't cry at my dad's or my best friends funerals either Is this an autism thing or is there something more at play Struggling with not crying,autism

1080,the bottom half of my house has flooded repeatedly over christmas today my landlord issued a section 21 eviction notice as the place has been declared unfit for habitation so now my flatmates and i have 2 months to find somewhere else to live a bit of background the 3 of us moved in together a year ago next week my best friend who has BPD and ADHD and his other best friend who is also autistic who i was friendly but not close with there was a lot of friction early on between myself and the other autistic because we're both bad at communicating and do things in a very different way which left my friend stuck in the middle and caused a lot of very loud arguments things settled down eventually as we adapted to each other but i quickly gave up on trying to develop a closer friendship with my autistic flatmate as she clearly wasn't interested in that the 3 of us living together is not tenable long term because of all this and with multiple private conversations with each of them ive come to the conclusion that the best way moving forwards is for me to find my own place and those two to live together without me she will be easier for my friend to live with than i am for one and i get crowded an unsociable far more easily than them which has put strain on my friendship as i havent had the same energy to hang out i have also said id be willing to share a flat with ym friend just the 2 of us its the 3 of us together that doesnt work now we expected to be living in the current set up for at least another year this evictionhas happened very suddenly and left us all somewhat unprepared the house is currently a disaster zone as the entire downstairs is flooded and we have had to move everything out of the flooded rooms which leaves 3 of us crammed into the 2 livable rooms upstairs with one bathroom between us when both of them have bathroom related anxieties which leaves me feeling like im walking on eggshells the stressors 1 when i told the others i thought it would be best if i found a place on my own my friend had a meltdown part of his BPD is rejection sensitivity and he feels like ive spurned him like its some sort of betrayal even though we have talked about this multiple times in the past and he agreed then he keeps going on rants about how its ok for me because i have options because i make a whole 80 a month more than him and my mum is willing to put me up for a week or two if i don't find a place on time this despite the fact that he has 3 other people as well as myself who have said they would like to share a flat with him 1 on 1 2 im in a panic now trying to find a new place to live and my family keep hammering home the point that i need to settle down and choose where im going to stay permanently i have no support network outside of my current home town but i work in the next town over and cant drive for medical reasons and the commute is getting more and more expensive and difficult so i dont know which town to move to plus my intention has alway been to move back to Ireland at some point in the future i dont want to live here forever 3 all the landlords agencies ive messaged to arrange a viewing have asked me a bunch of questions about my status and then ghosted me and i dont know why ive only been in my current job for 6 months and im worried that might be putting them off that or the reason im having to move suddenly 4 i have a grand total of 250 saved up which is only a third of what i need for a deposit i should get my portion of the deposit back from the current place which would be enough but then i still have to cover the first months rent up front and whether i can manage that or not is entirely down tot he timing of things if i have to pay the last month of rent from the old place out of the same paycheque then im fucked it really doesnt help that my mother is eternally suspicious of all of my friends she thinks im oblivious incompetent or something and feels she has to constantly hammer home how untrustworthy everyone is and how everyone wants to fuck me over she keeps trying to convince me that my flatmates are going to try and dupe me out of my 3rd of the deposit or move out suddenly and leave me holding the bag 5 ive only just gotten my room organised how i want it and was finally starting to feel at home now i'm going to have to uproot again pack everything up haul it to a new place and figure out how to squeeze it into a potentially much smaller space the stress of the whole thing is making me feel physically ill and giving me chest pains and palpitations i'm only just starting to get on top of my medical situation and now i might have to change GP all over again really struggling with this stress right now and need to vent moral support would be appreciated,autism

1086,There's a lot of discussion about masking referring to modifying our outward interactions with people that don't come naturally to us and compared to NT people it takes up a lot of our energy I was wondering if this is also true internally Like there is some sort of internal masking that NT people are able to use naturally with which they are able to protect their emotional well-being from external factors like criticism sensory overload or unexpected unplanned changes that would cause an ND person to have an emotional meltdown I feel like my inner self is too exposed and unprotected and an inability to internally mask leaves me to deal with a lot of emotions that I can't decode or handle causing a lot of fatigue External vs internal masking,autism
1087,Hii According to my mom I was diagnosed with infantile autism when I was about 3 years old I was sent to a program and met up with multiple social workers to lessen the major learning disabilities and anxiety issues I had However any time life s gotten just a little bit harder or there s been any change I get extreme anxiety and start acting up becoming emotional easily irritable biting my lips and cutting cuticles until they bleed These symptoms have gotten relatively worse over the years to the point where I feel like they re always present now My mom never even told me until I was diagnosed with autism until I was 17 because according to her I don t have it anymore but autism doesn t just go away I tried looking for my diagnosis papers and couldn t find any but my mom swears she didn t just make up the autism part lol I m 21 now and I m dying to get re-evaluated not only for validation within my family but I feel like I severely need medication because half the time I feel like I m on the brink of insanity Like I swear if it weren t for my issues becoming worse and worse I d have a 4 0 GPA and my bad grades could ve been preventable if I had just gotten help and treatment earlier on I don t wanna be on meds for the rest of my life but if that s the only thing that ll help me feel less like my anxiety is driving me insane and it s the only solution I can find then I ll happily take meds for the rest of my life I just don t know how to get diagnosed I haven t talked to my primary physician but she s very aware of my severe anxiety and suggested quartet health for me when I asked her about diagnosis All i m getting from there is therapy tho and none of them even accept my insurance I tried to look for offices and practices that diagnose autism on my own and found out that I ll have to pay 2000 if my insurance doesn t cover it WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE I ve taken the RAADS-R test and scored 137 which shows strong evidence for autism Does anyone have any advice on how I could get re-evaluated without hurting myself financially Any advice is appreciated How to get re-evaluated,autism
1088,Hi Sorry for my English first of all I visited a psychiatrist when I was 9 and I got diagnosed with Aspergers I ve heard this term shouldn t be used but I didn t really study that Now I m turning 18 soon I was never liked in my school People rarely approached me and I felt like I m complete weirdo I was bullied as well but I assume it was because my appearance I looked extremely weird I only had a couple of friends who weren t liked as well Now my looks have improved and I m in high school I started experimenting with make up changed my hair color changed my clothing style I dress kinda alternatively and I look fine most of teachers say that I look nice and approachable it didn t change my experience with people I m not being bullied anymore but they treat me like a weirdo even if I m being nice and helpful By treating like a weirdo I mean that for example they ll treat me like an air when we have to do group work or something I m quiet and shy but it doesn t really matter if I started speaking I will be ignored anyways Or stared at like I m some kind of freak It s hard to explain what I mean but I just feel like I m an outcast Fortunately I found a friend group here goes another problem In the beginning I had a good relation with all them Suddenly one of friend group member started acting very weird towards me Everytime she was talking about some random shit like her boyfriend I tried to keep convo going by asking questions and she seemed very annoyed about it She stopped talking to me and be friended my enemy That s the time when I realized that I m seriously lacking social skills and other people can probably sense it somehow even if I haven t spoke to them before No matter if I do or not they always think that Can other people sense I m autistic,autism
1089,I've been trying to find somebody else for an opinion on this for months and I haven't been able to find anybody The few autistic people I know haven't seen the film There is mention that Vincent could have a neurological condition and ADHD at the start of the film neurological condition 60 probability manic depression 42 probability attention deficit disorder 89 probability heart disorder 99 probability early fatal potential life expectancy 30 2 years He does obsess about space He doesn't let discrimination stop him He hides his identity and gives everything to take on the identity of Jerome Morrow to persue his dream of going to space I'm sure this film is a great metaphor for the lack of potential society sees in us too We're descriminated against and often take on low paid jobs despite having greater ambitions of doing professional jobs in areas like science and engineering to name just a few because very few companies people want to hire autistic people https youtu be E6xqDfrhwaA si m9vWNSsIXE50Z7D4 Is it just me or is the film Gattaca a great metaphor for masking,autism

1091,So for a little context I'm 24 and living with my 77 year old dad in a small flat in the UK I've recently got my own flat for the first time but I still haven't finished moving and going through everything I'm still basically living with my dad at the moment My new flat isn't far from his so it's just a lot of back and forth My long distance boyfriend is flying over from texas and will be staying for a couple of months and we will be in my new flat even though it's still bare and a work in progress Well my dad made the comment don't be surprised if I've taken your room when you get back and this really hit me hard It feels stupid to be so emotional and mad about a bedroom But it's so much more than that When I was around 12 13 I became a carer for my mum she was verbally emotionally and physically abusive and my dad didn't want to deal with that anymore on top of caring for her So he left me to deal with it I stopped being a carer when I was 20 for around 8 years I was stuck in a house with my abusive mum I had no where to go but my bedroom That was where I hid from everything where I felt safe It was MY space I could be myself without judgement it was where I found a little bit of peace Even after my mum passed away and we moved into different flats when I claimed a bedroom that was it That was my safe place In the past when me and my mum would stay with my aunt for the summer holidays my dad would stay home and when we returned he'd gone through the house and our stuff Thrown things away including personal items and moved everything No matter what we said to him he would still go ahead and do it He knew we wouldn't be there to stop him And I can't explain how it makes me feel knowing he's going to do this again next week when my boyfriend arrives If he wants the room fine He can have it But let me do it I can't stand the thought of him going through touching all my stuff and the fact that he just doesn't care about my space that space is very important to me I don't want to sound dramatic but it's a visceral feeling I want to cry and scream I feel so overwhelmed and stupid for getting like this over a room I'm sorry for the long post I just needed to talk about it Is anyone else here very attached to their bedroom,autism

1102,It's kind of stupid really because it happened for only some months in 7th grade when I first went into public school after being homeschooled but it's never left my mind since then They made fun of me for not making eye contact flinching at loud noises and being quiet and now I hate all of these within myself It feels specially bad because my disorder is somewhat the base of my personality When they make fun of me for its signs it's like they're making fun of the entirety of myself It's not like when someone says I'm getting fat or says oh I'd rather die than have to wear glasses in front of me I wear glasses So after some of these things were said to me I might have disliked my weight or my glasses but when they said these things about these ASD characteristics I just started to dislike myself instead And if I had actual friends I could have brushed it off and not paid it any mind but I can't since it kind of proves their point Bullied for autistic traits,autism

1108,Hi My son who is 3 and a half years old and diagnosed about 5 months ago He has developed a new stim of humping This would not worry me under normal circumstances but he specifically wants to hump girls and girls he is familiar with Surely if it was just a stim he wouldn't mind humping anything to satisfy the stim but he seeks out females He can hump for hours and will go back to even after being redirected over and over again plus he did one move that I found suspicious I feel he may have witnessed this sexualised behaviour somewhere and that is why he is copying it he does not live with me full time He is non verbal but has shown some capacity to learn if he really benefits like using YouTube to watch babyshark for hours New stim for my 3 and a half year old,autism

1110,I deliberately wrote look at and not look into because it doesn t feel deep It s just a face and I m mostly anxious when looking at them because it seems like they feel some connection looking at me but I am just looking at them being in some experience I can t understand I also don t understand why people want to be around others and talk to others just for mingling if it s not about a very interesting thing then it s just making me anxious I was never diagnosed but in the last year and looking back at my life I feel I might be autistic But I m definitely very highly functional which doesn t make me feel better because masking is an act of fear and communicating with others is very hard I usually don t make eye contact with my therapists but with normal people I try to do it occasionally to seem like I m not anxious and disconnected Just sharing Feel free to share if you relate Peace Idk if I m autistic but when I look at people s eyes I don t feel any connection anyone relate,autism
1111,For anyone that has the loops earplugs do they work for you I got mine today and I think it made my noise sensitivity worse I have misophonia as well as autism and I wanted them mostly so I could stand eating around people but I had them in the quiet setting and my partner drank his drink and it was like intensified I m so frustrated about it I wish I spent the 100 on noise canceling headphones instead of these Loops earplugs,autism
1112,I used to think autism was this severe mental retardation that is clearly visible But as I understand now it has a lot more depth than that I empathise with a lot of mildly autistic behaviours except for doing things repetitively pattern thingies stimming etc I can't seem to make a good judgement at all on social situations I am just masking as well as I can The more I read and think the more I think I have autism,autism
1113,I m 24 F and talking to an autistic guy 23 sometimes He is the kindest funniest and most intelligent guy I have met We talk occassionaly we live in two different countries bit both from Albania and he seems to be super interested when we text like totally im like wow we connect so well and he is also kinda romantic But then he just disappears with no contact and the only reason we talk again if i I reach out I am getting tired of it but he said he feels drained and needs space I think that is totally fair to have this need but i feel ignored and it makes me feel so bad cause i like him very much So my question is Is it common for autistic guys to need a lot of time alone space and can he still be interested in me even if he doesn t contact me in a long time Like it doesnt have to have anything to do with me what do you think and what can i do thank you so much Autism and ghosting Please help,autism
1114,My Dad definitely has Narcissistic Personality Disorder His manipulation tactics never really worked on me I cut him out more for the way he treated people around me Yet my family only cut him out recently Despite how many illegal and unforgivable things he had done Just showing how he managed to manipulate and gain sympathy from people for such a long time But it didn't work on me 2 of my best friends are well into their psychology degrees One teaches psychology She was talking about how narcissistic manipulation doesn't really work on people with autism We were laughing at how her dads manipulation tactics go right over her autistic sisters head I was watching saltburn with my other friend who's 6 years into his psychology degree He was saying narcissistic manipulation wouldn't work on me because I just wouldn't care Looking back he's right in 2022 I was at a dinner party and there was this classic grandiose narcissistic guy He showered me with compliments about my intelligence and appearance then tried to wow me with philosophical conversation I didn't really engage much because a lot of what he was talking about was convoluted and he was quite rude at times Eventually he lost his shit with me because I wasn't entertaining his charm And he straight up called me an idiot funnily enough not long after saying I seem smart and not autistic My friend who hosted the party drove me home and we bitched about him the whole car ride home hahahahaha I'm not saying me other autistic people are too smart to be manipulated I just more so think it'll go over our heads and won't land I know some really smart independent people who have been manipulated and taken advantage of for decades I think I could be manipulated but I would really need to be studied for it to work They'd probably have to research my special interests deeply and make me feel less alone in them But I highly doubt someone's gonna listen to Miliyah Kato's whole discography to manipulate me Tbh if someone does I'll be pretty impressed by the dedication TL DR How have you as an autistic person reacted to narcissistic manipulation How have to witnessed autistic people's reaction to it Did it work on them or did it not land I'd love to hear any stories of narcissists getting frustrated by their manipulation not landing with autistic people hahahaha Autism amp narcissistic manipulation,autism
1115,I recently finished my A-levels and have started studying physics at university during semester holidays I work as a Nintendo Technician for a contracted company of Nintendo The company has a no headphones or earphones policy which I emailed about beforehand and asked if I d be allowed to considering my autism they said no which in retrospect should have been my first red flag When I started they trained me for a week and then left me to it I did not ask for any support at the time but they were aware of my diagnosis The environment I was working in was rather noisy with constant minor noises talking typing etc and occasional loud noises lorries being offloaded etc The biggest problem for me was the constant minor noise and after a while I couldn t take it anymore I emailed HR and asked if I would be able to wear my noise cancelling headphones and I couldn t see a reason why they consider this to be an unreasonable adjustment at which point they then arranged a face-to-face meeting a member of health and safety She was lovely and basically said the only reason it was an issue was because I may not hear the fire alarm I just said that I was allowed to wear them at school and I was always able to hear the fire alarm and if not I would be able to see everyone evacuating the building as where the corridor by my desk is a major evacuation route She said that there was no issue then and she d pass it on to management 2 members of management then came to me 3 hours later and took me to a meeting room they were aware of the reason I needed headphones and I explained it to them They said that they could not allow for me to use my headphones as it is a major health and safety risk because I would not be able to hear the fire alarm I told them what health and safety said at which they responded that I need to be able to communicate with my colleagues which I do not have to at all because we all work independently and if someone needed to talk to me they could just tap me on the shoulder I just kept quiet to this and nodded I saw no point as they would just keep making excuses They said they re move me to a quieter work environment it was not which entailed me being reassigned jobs and being moved to a different location I was retrained for another week I cannot even comprehend the shear ignorance of this I m annoyed angry and resentful The job pays very well and I cannot afford to quit I need the money so I m stuck here My contract clearly stated that reasonable adjustments are to be put in place Denied Reasonable Support Adjustments in the Workplace UK,autism
1116,Hi all My bf has autism and ADHD I have the same but I m more ADHD with mild co-existing autistic traits I love that he has passions and his passion is his non-theistic religion meaning it s a way of life and traditions but you don t necessarily believe in a higher power It was fine at first when we started dating and he said he wanted his partner to understand his religion so I spent time reading up on it myself and engaged in conversations about it but I just find religion and sets of traditions so illogical and pointless but I appreciate that it s important to him For me it s a set of rules defined by society thousands of years ago when we knew very little as a species and these rules have caused countless wars and attempts to cleanse people who are different My special interest is in computing but I don t really talk about it because I know he has no idea about it and Im fine with that Usually with a special interest I d just say sorry can we talk about something else etc but this religion is also part of his identity and his way of life so it comes up so often and it s getting to the point where when I think of seeing him I just think of how I can avoid talking about it in a way that doesn t insult his beliefs It s part of his work his music tastes Friday night dinner I do find some of it interesting from an anthropology and history standpoint but it s getting to the point where the thought of his religion makes me feel turned off and resentful because I feel like I m forced to think about it all the time He s very high functioning and he s very lovely and stuff but he s also very sensitive I m not sure what to do Does anyone have any advice for me I know it s not his fault and he just wants to share his interest with me My boyfriend s special interest is his religion and I find religion a bit uncomfortable,autism

1119,Hello Let me begin by saying I don t have autism or ADHD instead I have different sensory needs around pain fatigue migraines etc SO sometimes in my house my housemate who is AuADHD becomes hyperfixated on jobs tasks which are often noisy This creates conflict while I m acutely ill as well as disabled and the noise high activity is generating distress and anxiety for me This is 100 my battle but I think asking for friends to be sensitive is reasonable My housemate is also not great at communicating her plans in the house but she does try and yet I end up in situations where I want to rip my brain out but can t physically go anywhere else I m usually quite flexible though I often feel like the jobs override my health needs and when I ask to delay a job or express that since I didn t know something very disruptive was about to occur it s upsetting I don t try to redirect her hyperfocus or stop her entirely I just express what is too overwhelming for me to deal with at the time so we can accomodate each other I m very willing to negotiate ie if it has a time limit and absolutely has to be done I ll work with it Am I mean for saying my housemate creates a lot of my stress What s the best way to get your basic needs met when someone is hyperfocussing if words and feelings aren t getting through Personally I feel that emotional and physical needs should be attended to first then tasks but as I said I don t have autism or ADHD to work with What works for you Trust me no one feels that their disability access needs are more annoying to ask for than ourselves How to balance different ND needs in one household,autism
1120,I'm in my late 20s and I only very recently figured out that I'm on the spectrum I used to think no I'm not on the spectrum at all I understand social situations well I am always masking and I don't do any repetitive stimming stuff I do it all the time and just straight up didn't realize It took me a while to realize that all these difficulties in my life as well as my interests are so perfectly explained by this I thought life was this difficult for everyone and that I was just lazy or didn't care enough to be as good at is as the others It turns out I actually just work a lot more in social situations to keep up the facade of being normal which I thought everyone was doing the whole damn time Everything I do outside my apartment is combined with a conscious effort not to be weird in some way and not to accidentally offend people which I later get very upset about because I feel like I've failed them And I think my favorite metaphor for this is the Steamed Hams https youtu be 4jXEuIHY9ic scene from the Simpsons What's actually happening in the background is pure and utter stressful chaos just to keep a rough facade of things being somewhat normal and functioning Any social event I have to attend is unbelievably exhausting to me and I feel like I am never myself unless I'm in my own apartment where nobody can see me I THOUGHT THIS WAS NORMAL I thought I was weak The Steamed Hams Simpsons scene is what masking feels like,autism

1122,I was diagnosed with autism around 8 months ago now along with ADHD Whenever I think about it I always think am I really autistic I ve spoken to a close friend about it multiple times and despite that I always feel the same I am not sure if its because my family immediately shut it down and say I can t be autistic or say I m making excuses for autistic traits or what Sometimes I am scared that i subconsciously was lying throughout the tests and thats why I have the diagnosis I guess realistically it doesn t matter this much but I just always see people speak about how it stopped all the previous confusion they had about it and im just wondering if anyone has felt the same way as me about it and how you approached it Doubting my autism diagnosis,autism

1126,So I am taking a course for a certificate and I was in the first group of presenters I had been researching the course material for the past few months and practicing the skills without knowing it so I already had a good grasp of what was being taught in the course when I started At the time I felt really unprepared anxious and stressed to speak in front of my class because I had thrown it together last minute and it just always gets to me It turned out that mine included the most information and the instructor said it was excellent We had a critique meeting and basically their critiques were to add more info When instructor would talk about something specifically I would try to elaborate on my thinking process and the idea behind what I had written to try to give them a better understanding and be on the same page and to make sure I understood what they were talking about The instructor started making comments about how it s not expected to be perfect and it just gave me the impression that they thought I was fighting their grading but I was just trying to add information When asked if I had any questions I asked if they thought I had a good grasp on the concept so I could feel comfortable moving forward and the response was I think you think you do and then a laugh and the other instructor laughed and raised her eyebrows I m just not sure what the purpose of all that was Were they trying to ease my anxiety or were they being condescending I don t understand why adding information automatically means I m disagreeing fighting with you Why is it perceived that way I just feel like the communication I gave was not perceived the intended way at all even though I was also agreeing with them the entire time Why did this happen,autism
1127,This is a long one This has been confusing me for a while and I don t know how I m supposed to talk go about things I m very sorry for any inconvenience I appreciate you for reading in whatever capacity My 22F friend John 24M has autism He was diagnosed back in elementary school He s noticed traits of autism in me John has cited my repetitive and restrictive diet and how I won t consume the majority of food due to the texture the fact I wear my socks inside out and have removed all of the tags from my clothing I ve been wearing the same clothes since 2015 because I just don t like itchy things lol the things I have memorized generally the way I act etc as reasons for why he thinks I could potentially be autistic While I agree that by behavior can be unhealthy and odd it doesn t necessarily qualify as a developmental disorder nor disability Lately John s been more vocal about me seeking a diagnosis and or help It doesn t bug me too much I want to clarify that there is absolutely nothing inherently wrong with folks with autism I appreciate that he notices and attempts to sort-of validate things about me that I ve always tried very hard to hide However I have a feeling he s going to keep on suggesting that I seek a diagnosis until I actually go seek a diagnosis I m not going to pay hundreds of dollars for a professional just to confirm that I don t have autism I will only seek a diagnosis if I can reasonably assume that I 1 have autism and 2 a diagnosis will have a significant enough benefit on my life I generally fit the mainstream criteria that you see on social media however I assume that mainstream social media doesn t accurately depict of autism I have a feeling it sometimes might romanticize autism a bit and I would like to know more about what they don t generally tell you about autism I have a meltdown every so often however I would like to learn more about autistic meltdowns v neurotypical meltdowns Sometimes I get embarrassingly cranky when there s a lot going on ie when babies cry is the first that comes to mind but I can t recall recent a time where I ve had an intense reaction to the environment I can recall a recent time when I ve had an intense outburst no yelling just crying rocking back and forth biting on a pillow shaking etc but that was because someone posted my artwork on their facebook page and had just assumed I gave them permission to because I texted a picture of it to them It was not a result of stimuli in my environment ie noise etc Alright with all that information out of the way I guess my main questions as I start to consider seeking a potential diagnosis include 1 How do I seek a cost-effective yet totally legitimate way to get tested 2 What are aspects of autism that neurotypical folks aren t typically educated on ie meltdowns 3 With the given information please let me know if there is anything else I can provide in the comments what is your take on anything I ve mentioned This is a broad question I m not sure how to narrow it down I genuinely have no idea where to go from here Thank you so much for being here My friend with autism thinks I ought to seek a diagnosis for myself but I don't know much about autism or where to go,autism

1145,Hello I am 26 years old and I used to have seizures around 9 times during 2001-2004 My family brought me to the hospital at that time for a brain check due to the frequent seizures During my kindergarten year I was very naughty extremely hyperactive and didn't really have alot of friends I was a loner and kind of bullied and tended to hang out with just one or two friends I remember that my whole kindergarten school tried to find me one day because I saw hens nearby tried to reach out to them and ended up in a farm near my kindergarten school the whole day My kindergarten teacher told my parents that I might have autism and suggested putting me in a special class At that time my parents were mad at the teacher and brought me to the hospital for an EEG brain test The result indicated autism but my parents didn't believe it They still tell me to this day that the result wasn't accurate because during the test some of the wire cables were off due to my hyperactivity and they were put back on My mom shared this with me and then she took me to another hospital where the doctor diagnosed me as hyperactive Today I still have problems regarding focusing impulsiveness and concentration Initially I didn't think I had any of these issues since my mom didn't accept it and tried to tell me I was normal However now I face many struggles and I want to understand the root of it I wonder if I have ADHD or autism To be more precise I am just like any normal guy who studies and works now but I always had trouble studying I am easily distracted by noise or sound while studying and when learning or reading I get distracted very easily I have a hard time studying and focusing especially if it's not something I'm obsessively interested in Can an EEG brain test have a mistaken result,autism
1146,So my sister has been looking to get into grad school for psychology and one thing needed is a statement of why psychology is important to her And I recently found out through seeing a text to my mom that she plans to write this statement about how my suicide affected her In my last attempt of two she was the last person I reached out to who ultimately did end up stopping my attempt I will admit I was resentful she did call emergency services on me to take me back to a ward I absolutely hated that experience However since then we have been not cold but at least cordial But seeing her write such a personal thing about me even if it is ultimately just viewed by one person still troubles me Her conclusion basically too is that she stopped putting me first and rather herself Now granted I did involve my sister in my most recent attempt over a year ago but the previous times I haven t spoken with her much at all She also mentions how it was like clock work at this point for my autistic and suicidal brother Which yah I have been suicidal for a while but I ve mostly tried to keep it to myself Mentioning autism in the same sentence also rubs me the wrong way Yes it has made my life difficult but I never thought it would make her feel like I m a burden on her Ultimately I have no idea if I should even breach this subject to her At this point I doubt her statement will win her any favors from whoever reads it as I struggle to see how anyone can come to a conclusion other then what I did that it just tells the story of how she moved past a burden and I guess the burden was me an autistic and suicidal person who ironically she says she wants to help My sister is using my suicide attempt for her grad school statement,autism

1172,So I found out from my birth mother a few years ago I was diagnosed with autism when I was maybe 5ish I was put into foster care at 10ish and then adopted maybe a year in It seems obvious looking back now but my adopted parents never mentioned the word autism to me Just that I had an IEP and was slow So I never even thought of myself as anything other then that Which again looking back was a bad thing I'm 31F and after so much healing and finally not being suicidal and depression slowly not being the worst thing ever I've come to find out that I have BPD CPTSD and I'm looking back into the autism diagnosis But when I brought this up to my counselor she says she sees no autism in me It's just all the other stuff and I don't meet the criteria of today's diagnosis That what they thought was autism then wasn't fully what it is and I just got lumped in In some cases I can understand that cause it is still a very researched thing I also see myself as I guess nurotypical but not really I don't know who I am really at the moment I was told there was nothing wrong with me and I just wasn't trying hard enough to fit in with my family The more I allow myself to let go and unmask and just let myself stim and feel and meltdown and be nonverbal and have resting bitch face and have little random noises come out and just looking back But I have eye contact and don't mind crowds and can talk to people pretty decent and can work in teams and don't mind concerts and want socialness sometimes and the huge amount of self awareness other typical normal behaviors I'm questioning a lot Has anyone else been in this situation Being told you could grow out of a diagnosis like that Can you grow out of an autism diagnosis,autism

1179,I love books and I seem to fall into special interests where the only way to get specific information is books Not even e-books Physical books I've been studying the Ainu people of Japan since 2018 and I've collected nearly 40 books for my collection on them I've spent over 2300 before tax and shipping on that collection A couple books were 100 a pop then one was 300 before tax I finally decided to buckle down and read more falconry books and I narrowed it down to about 8-12 Cannot be bothered to count I just added it up and that small collection will add up to about 400 after tax and shipping Those books are steeper in price because they've probably been printed in small batches and are more specialised knowledge so I'm paying a premium Some of them are 60 for one book Gosh the price we're sometimes willing to pay for special interests Grr why must my special interests be so expensive,autism

1187,This is a really bad title but I couldn't think of a better way to phrase it Basically I was diagnosed as an adult with autism like a lot of other women are nearly four years ago In the report they included that I would've been diagnosed with Asperger's but because it isn't a diagnosis anymore I have an ASD diagnosis I am fine with this and it was such a relief to hear But this year I'm going to be turning 30 and I'm having a bit of a crisis tbh I haven't done anything anyone my age would do I've never been in a relationship not even kissed or held hands with a romantic partner I've never had a paying job I couldn't finish my university degree twice so I've had to drop out of university twice I am also physically disabled and this started when I was a teenager so I didn't have much of a chance but now I feel like I really don't I actively avoid people anyway I have no idea how to deal with anyone I'm worried I'm actually more autistic than I thought that I was told I am high functioning but I'm really lower middle functioning I know nobody uses that anymore but I can't explain it better tbh I have semi-regular meltdowns and they've just got more frequent as I've got older My mum is basically my carer for a lot of reasons but one of those is definitely the autism I thought I had okay self-awareness but I don't think I do I think I'm actually really autistic and I never realised It feels like it's too late to do all of those things now And that I have no experience in anything at all And that I'm lower scoring on the spiderweb of autism than I thought idk maybe me thinking this automatically means I'm not but I have no idea I feel so behind in everything and part of me is like it doesn't matter what society thinks you should've done and the other part of me is like I kinda do care though I feel mentally about 16 even though when I was 16 I felt much older I don't know Basically can you get worse at autism Can you be more autistic than you realised professionals diagnosed you as I don't want platitudes or anything and I don't want to be told that it's all society's fault or whatever I'm not looking for that I'm not here for any of that Please can you just help me and answer the questions or tell me if you've experienced this too please Thank you Can you be more autistic than you actually thought were diagnosed as,autism
1188,Some people I understand can live without social media I am not one of those people While I am not obsessed with it it makes it easier for me to find out about certain people I know and events in my area that otherwise I may not find out about so easily or have easy contact Some people Facebook or Messenger is my only way to talk because I have no phone number or email address for them unless if I really wanted to write a hand written letter Some events Facebook may be the only way I will find out So it's like Facebook I am using for dear life I do wish I had more likes and comments than my peers because it makes me feel inferior but I have to understand they have had it much longer than me and that I only got it in 2020 Anytime before that would not have been a good time for me to have it not even MySpace in the 2000s I need Facebook for the life of me,autism
1189,I usually am either extremely excited or jovial or laid-back and quiet The problem is when I m laid back and quiet people mistake that for me being upset or for me being sad but I m not We went to Disneyland or Sunday with my mom and her boyfriend and my mom constantly tried to grab me and asked me if I was excited It was eight in the morning and I was tired as it takes me about five hours or so to feel awake after waking up so I was not excited and I wasn t feeling any emotions at the moment so I told her that It s a Manchester trapes not sure enough emotion How can I show the right amount of emotion especially in the morning because I tend to be tired until afternoon or late morning time so no matter how much sleep I get so I don t really feel like talking or do anything until the afternoon How to make people not concerned or not think I m upset when I was simply resting my face,autism

1192,I always push myself to my absolute limits because I think I m capable of much more than I actually am and I m extremely stubborn so I m always extremely burnt out but when I do take time off I never seem to get better I don t know what to do because I always try to do the things that I know sometimes helps but it s never really enough Currently I ve taken some time off of school because I have no energy to do anything or talk to anyone and I feel sad a lot for no reason I suspect it s just because I have no energy Any advice on how I can try to regain my social battery I feel like I can never regain any social battery,autism
1193,So there s something that I myself do and I see other autistic people doing sometimes When I start imagining a scenario or start thinking really hard about something I lose control of my body and kind of leave the world My eyes and ears and sense of touch are working but I won t really perceive anything on that people are saying or doing around me in this state Another thing that happens is I start moving a lot I will flap my hands start pacing as well as making gestures with my hands like if I m talking to someone I will also make weird facial expressions and blink strangely Sometimes I also start mouthing or even say the words of the character of imagining or the words that I m saying to characters in my head out loud This happens unconsciously although I do remember everything that I do When I was a little kid it used to be much worse but as I got older it s still been hard for me to imagine things without looking like something is wrong with me I have seen other autistic people including my crush 18M who is a teenager one year older than me who did the same thing where sometimes they would start pacing around rapidly as well moving around their hands and looking back-and-forth as well as talking in a weird whisper voice like they re talking to someone else I remember he used to say Elmo say your ABC s or you re too young to be the president in middle school when he used to do it Do you know what this is why it happens and how I can be able to imagine and how I can retreat in my head without losing control of my body Does anyone else do this and do you know why,autism

1195,There's plenty of resources out there on how to make friends and I feel like I have plenty of information but the one thing that's stopping me is what I do after How do I keep friends once I make them What am I even supposed to do with them It was easy in school because we had alloted times to spend together lunch time and we just talked about school and the group was big enough that I could go silent if they talked about something else But now I'm an adult and have literally no idea what to do Is all the stress and uncertainty even worth it How to keep Friends,autism
1196,Hello I want to preface this in stating that I have not been formally diagnosed with Autism I ve wondered for a long time if I do have Autism but I haven t been to a psychiatrist in a long time due to some past trauma One of the main things I struggle with is noise sensitivity I ve had it all my life Loud noise especially yelling physically hurts my ears and makes me start shaking uncontrollably I currently live in a very loud household My sister s husband has just a naturally loud voice and he is constantly yelling at everything tv video games his son I ve had discussions with him and he is very aware of my sensitivity to noise But nothing has changed It s also not really fair of me to say he can t express himself by being loud My question is does anyone have any suggestions on dealing with noise sensitivity and or how to block out noise I have some noise canceling headphones but they only block out so much They don t seem to block out yelling Noise travels very well up into my room so going in there is not much of an escape either I feel like my sensitivity has gotten worse since living here and it s been making me very tired and irrationally angry I don t want to ruin my relationship with my sister and her husband if I accidentally snap Leaving is not an option due to a lease and finances right now Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated Noise Sensitivity Help,autism

1198,Hi I was diagnosed with ASD about 2 months ago I 24f was originally diagnosed with ADHD and Generalised Anxiety Disorder at age 14 The symptoms of both had been presenting since I was younger in primary elementary school and I was often in trouble in school however there was a lot going on at home during this time and so I was never brought to see a psychologist psychiatrist when I was younger I did see special-ed teachers for a bit but that was about it When I did go to see a psychologist psychiatrist it was in my teens because I was having anxiety attacks and trouble with identifying my own emotions understanding the intentions of others black and white thinking etc I failed to mention a lot of issues at the time to my psychologist psychiatrist as I was overwhelmed by the whole experience The word spectrum was thrown around but I was not officially diagnosed at this time I have always had issues such as discomfort fright when being touched off of by other people unless I am expecting inviting it various issues with fidgeting and ticks and extreme aversions to certain noises or smells I did not mention any of this as I genuinely thought it was strange and a bit taboo at the time I also have always had avid interests in certain topics that some would call obsessive and I am essentially a hermit outside of my working hours Even with all of this however I am actually relatively sociable I sometimes insult people unintentionally however I have genuinely very rarely met anybody that I didn t immediately get along with as I would consider myself genuine and no bs I also have a good group of friends After receiving the ASD diagnosis I mentioned it to some friends and family those who I told essentially said the same thing that I feel That I generally integrate normally into society however the traits I exhibit most definitely would indicate some level of neurodiversity Since my therapy has been tailored to accommodate for the ASD diagnosis my mental health has improved quite substantially for the first time ever The issue I am facing currently is that I get a lot of comments from people I know regarding my reclusive tendencies and I also tend to become irritated and aloof when feeling overwhelmed in various settings My psychologist is encouraging me to voice to others when I am feeling overwhelmed however this is new for me I am used to coping until I feel overwhelmed and then essentially going into a reclusive period in my room for 3 4 5 days I feel that if I am able to voice to others when I am overwhelmed I may be able to lead a more balanced life without the need for as many extended periods of reclusiveness I am wondering if anyone else was diagnosed in later life And perhaps has used my methods of hiding away shutting down previously and is now making an effort to communicate their needs I would like some advice as to how I can do this with friends family without coming across as rude or pushy or self-centred bonus points if you have any advice regarding professional environments also Sorry for the long post and thank you for reading I Am Unsure How To Communicate My Needs To Others,autism

1200,I am a late self-diagnosed woman who went a lifetime with no support for my autism or mental illnesses When things got so bad I had a suicidal breakdown I ended up writing a book that was basically a scream into the universe because I had absolutely no one to talk to about it and was having ZERO success trying to navigate non-existent supports for the undiagnosed I just feel like society does not give a single sh t about autistic adults Everything we struggle with is put down to personal failures I live with so much anger every day and I'm just supposed to hide it from everybody I ended up contacting the local news saying please do a story on autistic adults with no help They do stories on the dumbest sh t like a woman who ate 48 oysters and saddled her date with the bill Of course it was crickets from every network I reached out to Why does literally no one seem to care AT ALL about autistic adults who are suffering We have all these forums and closed support groups where autistic people vent their most pressing struggles and put into words so gloriously why it's so hard being autistic But nobody outside of those circles is seeing any of that All people see is the AutismAwareness tags and the Autism Speaks bullsh t and puzzle pieces All they hear about are stereotypes of our community It's pissing me off so much I can't even begin to tell you If we could somehow organize the autistic folks online in a solid effort to make our situations more public I feel like we could inch out of obscurity and at least take a step in the right direction We could build pressure until social structures cannot help but change or face consequences It's working for other groups who demand visibility why not us I just keep thinking there must be SOMETHING we can do to boost autistic adult struggles into the public sphere Because I can literally feel myself losing it and heading to an all-out breakdown Thoughts ideas edit I did not originally include this because I was afraid it would be flagged as promotion But I have maintained this website for a couple months now I call it the Autistic Visibility Project and it's my way of boosting autistic voices by simply listing out their grievances in a testimonial style I still can't get the star ratings removed as it was a template for actual testimonials But anyway I invite everyone who wants to air their grievance to submit a text-based complaint rant or other first-hand experience through the contact form A recently thing I've started is to accept video submissions of talking heads just ranting to the camera too If anyone is interested please submit https autisticvisibilityproject com submit amp x200B How can we get society to give a F about autistic adults,autism

1202,I was diagnosed at 17 i'm 21 now and this doesn't really make sense to me Isn't it just a thing you like more than other things or is it something you've liked for a very long time I sometimes see people say they found a new special interest but to me it is literally just a new thing they found and like Please explain Maybe it's hard for me to understand because aside from ROBLOX and osu I haven't ever been heavily invested into one thing I played ROBLOX pretty much every day all day after school from around 8 to 16 and osu from 18 to present why do you call the thing s you like a special interest,autism

1205,Hello everyone I 29F am fairly new to learning about neurodivergence I've been reading and researching a lot about it for about a year and talked to a professional about getting an official autism diagnosis The thing is that in my country the waiting list is around 3 years especially for female adults In the meantime I got diagnosed as gifted which in my country is classified as a neurodivergence like autism and ADHD I don't need an official paper for autism so I would be fine with a self-diagnosis however some things are still puzzling me with no option to talk to a specialist about it so here I am I display a lot of autism symptoms in women among which no social understanding mimicking social situations especially younger echolalia unable to recognize faces seeing everything in patterns need to classify things restricted interest intense passion sensory issues especially related to sounds difficulty to feel when I need to eat sleep things related to my body GAD and light moderate OCD I'm learning to balance everything out and to accommodate my lifestyle to something that would fit me better However I notice I hate routines I simply can not I find them excruciatingly painful Sometimes even eating at lunch or going to pee are things I see as an external annoying demand that I have to do around the same time every day I also notice that I need surprises actions unexpected events in my life for example going on a trip I'm thriving on this dopamine surge and I usually want more and more and more until I'm exhausted I also have anxiety when these events happen because it's out of my life box But I also have anxiety if my life is too much in control lol Searching about how to find balance on this issue I stumbled upon the terms of AuDHD and PDA autism I also understand that autism is a spectrum so maybe I simply don't need a routine If someone could enlighten me on this topic and how to differentiate all of these I would be very grateful Thanks Side note if that matter almost all my friends all my life are ADHDers Side note 2 not looking for a diagnosis just trying to understand Difference between AuDHD Autism with no need for routine PDA autism,autism
1206,Maybe it s the sense of justice so many of us innately have or the ability to see patterns but more than ever lately it feels like living in the US is a dystopian movie It feels impossible to avoid how awful things are getting and it seems like everyone turns a blind eye and I feel crazy for pointing it out I m not trying to be negative but I feel like a canary in a coal mine How does everyone deal with things just being so casually cruel and deal with the reality that most people just don t give a shit about others It eats at me and on days like this it has me in a full blown spiral because it feels so hopeless Any and all advice discussion welcomed How do y all deal with the casual cruelty of the world,autism

1209,I 29M like to think I have a pretty healthy relationship with my Autism I view it as one of several entities inhabiting my body kinda like the movie Inside Out but different and as long as I respect and understand its wants and needs I have some choice in whether or not to listen to it But I also have some patience and empathy for myself when it leads me to do things I wish I hadn't Sometimes however I do listen to it when it's the loudest voice in the room and really regret it This is about one of those times For those who don't live in the US or those who do and don't know the rule of thumb here is to stick to the right hand side of two way pedestrian traffic Idk if it's to emulate the side of the road we drive on but it makes sense that people walking in opposite directions should have a side they always stick to keep traffic moving And you can bet your butt that my Autism always knows which side of any physical space I'm supposed to be on As I'm walking downstairs to the subway coming home from work I see a man coming up the stairs on his left my right hand side Now I make the decision to stay to the right because I wouldn't want to block someone who comes up the stairs on their right side and if this man doesn't see me or doesn't care I can always move around him Well he never looks up so I move to my left at the last minute squeeze past him and say excuse me Crisis averted right Well he yells at me what are you doing man and lightly swats at me Really not a big deal It's New York In the United States On the planet earth There are literally rude people everywhere I tried my best to laugh it off but I fixated on it The whole train ride home Why is HE scolding ME He was on the wrong side AND I went around him I was not hurt I was not in danger I did not feel scared or intimidated I was however made to feel slightly uncomfortable by someone who was not following the rules and it became nearly all I could think about for 45 minutes In spite of me telling myself it wasn't important don't get stuck on it Do stop me if that sounds familiar to you Either way it won't ruin my night Thanks y'all for listening My Autism Moment of the Day,autism
1210,I m obsessed with zero sugar drink mixes and I ve been listening to Running Up That Hill by Kate Bush over and over and over I m also obsessed with emojis especially when new ones are coming out but that s an all the time fixation What is everyone s current hyper fixation song on loop,autism
1211,For people who have gone through CPT cognitive processing therapy or either big T or little t traumas did you find it effective I f25 am a little over two months in and I don't know how to feel other than it feels like it's going so incredibly slow Although I am 2 months into it I am still doing the ABCs Most sessions are spent with my therapist engaging in Socratic questioning around my stuck points namely guilt and shame Socratic questioning feels a lot like debating idk if this is just because I have autism but I'm not the biggest fan of it With debating I always want to win and will stick by my argument defending it but I know I should not be defending my reasoning during Socratic questioning However I feel like I have to prove my point because others might not understand the reason why I did something def feel like this is an autism trait and in defending my stance I am not fully using Socratic questioning and allowing myself to see my therapist's perspective which is the whole reason for this type of questioning in the first place Anyhow would love your thoughts on CPT Socratic questioning defending your stance in therapy trauma modalities that worked for you etc Thoughts on cognitive processing therapy,autism
1212,Just about every day now on this sub I see shit like the higher lower support needs are oppressing us being ableist whatever from both sides of the sub Freaking stop it already You are gaining nothing from antagonizing each other and constantly blaming each other for the oppression we're all facing This is supposed to be a community not a war zone If we can't come together and fall into a pit of constant infighting and trying to one up each other in who struggles more then we'll all become ableist We're all struggling so the last thing we need is more conflict The us vs them mentality needs to stop,autism
1213,I wanna ask any of those who have been diagnosed or re-diagnosed how long did you get your results back I got re-evaluated during early November I had called the office around thanksgiving checking to see when it would be ready and they said it would be ready around post-thanksgiving Nothing I called them again around early-mid december last month to ask again and told them to email me the results when they were ready still nothing in my emails part of me thinks I got scammed but I honestly don't know since I've been going to them before the court had denied me to go further since payments didn't get authorized to continue and I felt like talking to them actually helped get some of the things off that were triggering me and bothering me too much before asked for an evaluation by their psychologist Really curious,autism
1214,When I was younger I used to use the notes app but it is so awkward since people don t understand you or just become stand offish and puts a lot of anxiety to type faster I don t know how to get access to support from the government since I m technically not diagnosed so I m in a very weird limbo What do you do when you are too tired to talk in public,autism

1216,hello everyone i am asking a question here because i have been thinking about my situaion for a long time and i hope you guys can help me a bit i also apologise for the lenghty post in advance there is a person i have known for quite a while and i have the impression that he is exhibiting traits and behaviour that are connected to asd he is a young adult and he has never been officially diagnosed with any neurodivergent disorder my friend could mainly be described as a quirky or eccentric character when i first met him i immediately noticed that he was very talented in several different fields very smart and observant on people's behaviour he accurately predicted peoples actions and personalities by recognising their behaviour patterns although he still often missed out on social cues and came off as unintentionally rude he was also a below average student and largely lacked organisational skills the guy rarely got along with people at school because he was belittled and laughed about he did stand up for himself though and was never shy or quiet about the bullying i have been told that autistic people rather often exhibit these traits he had a very special talent of coming up with sarcastic and hurtful comebacks and generally being a very entertaining person can austistic people understand sarcasm i heard they often can't do and that they are rather straightforward now here are the things that i am concerned about even as an adult he still doesn't have many friends around 2-3 has difficulty making new friends often misunderstands social rules and seemingly can't understand concepts like romantic interactions he never realises when someone is trying to flirt with him he loves every opportunity he gets to talk about his special interests and drowns people in his little rants not noticing or ignoring that they are not interested what first made me think that he may be autistic is the fact that he was always burned out overstimulated and seemed overly stressed compared to our other peers my friend also seems like an emotionless person at first but i did witness several of his randomly appearing meltdowns troughout our friendship moments when he was being dramatic for no explainable reason in his words it was often connected to the burnouts mentioned above some of his behaviours when he was a younger child could confirm my assumption according to his family he was almost nonverbal barely interacted with peers followed a strict selfmade routine in every day and already had a special interest the same one he still holds on to this day this could come from the fact that he was quite socially isolated as a child for a while he is an only child and his parent's often weren't around when he was a toddler maybe he just missed out on important social development there i do not expect a professional diagnosis for my friend here but i still hope you people can give me some advice from your own experience even if my friend is autistic and or refused to get an official diagnosis i would still like to know how i could accomodate to his needs in our day to day interactions thank you is he on the autism spectrum,autism
1217,I'm the type of autistic who is very routine-driven and where if I say something I mean it I really want the same from others but it's so different and the confusion conflict between their words and actions and breaking of routines really stresses me out I've brought this up and they usually apologise and acknowledge the problem but it doesn't change Basically one of my friends said he wanted to see me on 3 separate occasions recently christmas NY and my birthday He said this so I then asked oh what day time and where and then he stopped acknowledging my messages it really hurt because I really got my hopes up excited I also was invited to another friend's place twice last month both times I arrived on time but I was waiting outside for 30 minutes in cold and rain for them to come down first time they were all like oh you didnt need to wait outside you should go somewhere warm second time I did and texted where I was but they rang and were like you wandered off it was like playing an NT social game I know everyone with autism is different I just can't figure out why you'd act like this they say they just forget things My autism conflicting with my friends autism,autism
1218,I wanna ask the people on this sun who are in or finished college how they picked their degree career when I m deciding on mine and specifically how did your passions special interests factor into that How should I choose mine Should I focus on meeting in the middle or going for what I love For context I love history geography politics and philosophy psychology humanities stuff feels like ironically cus I m quiet ofc But I also love nature and getting outside and animals and natural geo history etc So I m going to do a minor or double major with either geography or environmental studies I could do the both together but I could also do one with one of the things above like History Anthropology which I m rlly passionate abt etc I m really torn on what to prioritize when I like so many things and feel like there s different conflicting factors influencing my choices I don t know whether to prioritize money or passion or the environmental helping people aspect so ideally I d like to find something that meets them all in the middle The degree I d choose if I was just going off of passion without the climate crisis and need for money would be anthropology or history w maybe a minor in Geog to become a archeaologist journalist or historian or professor For money it would be more government or law I ve always just kind of been the best at finding information and then teaching it to people so IK I have a teaching ability and want to pursue something related to that So maybe grad school education degree journalism etc but I also feel a pull towards politics or planning What should I do TLDR Should I base my degree on my special interests passions or should I go for something that combines them w a field that makes money How did you decide on yours as an autistic person People one the sub who have one how did you decide on your degree career,autism

1223,Hi all If I was thinking about going to speak to a doctor about adult autism would it be worth taking along all the online tests I've done Currently going through therapy for childhood trauma and cptsd but I believe everything always leads back to autism ADHD Mentioned ADHD to 2 doctors and got laughed at Mentioned autism to my psychologist after doing online tests and she asked me a few questions to which she then agreed that I tick a lot of boxes for autistic traits Trying to tell her that the childhood trauma feels like it's dealt with but this potential autism ADHD could rip my life apart I ended my last appointment early due to being angry and feeling like she was focusing on things that don't matter as much My next appointment isn't until next week and I'm already dreading it I'm so lucky I'm married to the most amazing understanding woman and we have 3 children They are 8 5 and 1 They are also amazing but I see so many of my traits in the elder two and it worries me as I still don't know how to handle life and I'm 35 I just want the best for my family Just looking for advice,autism

1225,I've felt different my whole life and have never had an explanation for my mannerisms and or behaviors I started my spelunking into the internet to find answers to it all and everything pointed toward being neurodivergent As a kid I preferred walking on tiptoe and would crawl around on all fours clear into teenage years because I mimic my cats I still shriek weird noises while bathing repeat lines from shows I watched decades ago and will say the same lines songs for years Around others I avoid looking people in the eye staring at the ceiling if there are too many people and sounds and becoming bored with company quickly I fixate on certain stuffed toys and sleep with my arms tucked to my chest while holding them I found comfort sleeping in the bottom of my closet as a child I hate wearing rough clothing or flowing clothing that tickles my arms I'll gag if I eat something gummy or unexpectedly crunchy the list goes on I'm so glad I don't have to explain why I am who I am or sound like I'm making excuses I'm autistic and ADHD and I'm relieved Got my diag at 37 and I'm not surprised,autism
1226,TW Childhood abuse medical mental neglect self harm mention I did not know many other children growing up and did not go to preschool My parents took me to the doctor only when absolutely necessary and I never saw a mental health professional until I was 14 When I was in kindergarten other children found me annoying because of how loud and excitable I was There was a speech therapist that worked with students on an individual basis who needed extra help My parents found out through me that I was getting extra help and were upset at the school for not telling them My family moved to a European country when I was 5 and did not know the language I was put in a grade below peers my age I struggled immensely and teachers noted that I may have autism that is impacting my language learning My parents denied it and pulled me out of the school when they continued to recommend treatment Having no outlet I started self harming by banging my head against the wall I was grasping the language better but when i started at my second school noted that I was inattentive and struggled to hear understand clearly I started getting frequent ear infections which were assumed to be the cause After getting tubes in my ears they found that my hearing was normal but I was still struggling with speaking understanding I picked up the language and reading writing nearly all at once in second grade but struggled immensely to make interpersonal connections My family then moved back to the United States To my parents annoyance I was put into ESL classes upon coming back to the United States Eventually by 4th grade I was found to be performing on the same level as my peers Teachers again noticed my inattentiveness and difficulty with organization and recommended an after school organization club to help with this My parents were upset at the recommendation and ignored it even though I wanted to go In 5th grade everything came to a head when traumatic events at home caused me to act out at school I was put in a special self-esteem building lunch program which again my parents were upset at the school for My mental health issues related to autism but primarily from trauma caused me to be sent to the school psychologist's office frequently They scheduled a meeting with my mom about getting me a psychological evaluation My parents refused I was pulled out of that school Child protective services were called to the home due to obvious mental neglect related to my parents refusal to seek treatment My family moved nearly every year so nothing came of it I learned how to mask and began getting excellent grades but teachers still expressed concerns about my ability to listen pay attention and my lack of social skills I had a friend adaptation strategy because of how frequently I moved I would seek out the outwardly nerdiest people and begin talking about video games or anime to see if I encountered someone easy to be friends with Unbeknownst to me at the time I was seeking out other autistic individuals and was surrounding myself with them as my peers In high school I finally had the emotional and mental space to realize that something was wrong at home abuse that is not relevant to the sub and was able to speak to the school about my difficulties I was pulled from my home and placed into foster care and began seeing a mental health professional Because of the severity trauma and mental illness I was not even able to tackle the underlying symptoms of autism until now as an adult after 14 years of therapy Most of what I have written here was so suppressed that it took me until adulthood to even remember these details Living in Europe was a gigantic gap in my memory until I started EMDR therapy I couldn't sleep last night I googled the physical outward symptoms of autism Flat feet wide mid face low set ears Check check and check I looked in the mirror the tops of my ears start below the center point of my eyes when I look straight on I thought everyone else's ears were too high No wonder my glasses fall off of my face when I lean over I felt angry My symptoms were glaringly obvious from the second I was enrolled in kindergarten and I could have been receiving support I was attending school and university on hard mode and felt that I was a failure for not being able to perform at the same level as my peers My parents constantly made my symptoms out to be a sign of my personal failings me being lazy not trying hard enough not paying enough attention I was told I threw temper tantrums that I was a habitual liar that I was a drama queen I hear their voice in the back of my head every time I perceive that I've done something wrong I finally feel comfortable being angry I've learned that just because I'm feeling a negative emotion does not mean that I'm in the wrong There's nothing wrong with me seeking attention by sharing my experiences It's taken a long time to learn this I've broken so many relationships to get here I know this is a lot to read and I appreciate those who've taken a glance at what I have to say I'm curious if there are others who have had their parents repeatedly deny their autism to schools and doctors Growing up schools tried to help Instead my parents denied my symptoms,autism
1227,I wrote this initially as a submission to a subreddit focused on quitting cannabis cannabis dependence I kept adding in past traumas and failures for context as my motivation for cannabis use is mostly an emotional attachment that is inextricably linked to my experience as a previously undiagnosed neurodivergent I want to be clear that I do not yet have an official diagnosis of Autism but everything else I mention has been confirmed by multiple mental health professionals on different occasions I have also consulted with multiple organizations and individuals who specialize in Autism and all responses have indicated that I'm on to something I also don't think it's a coincidence that I can relate more to the anecdotes and experiences that I've read on this subreddit than I can to any other group of people I've ever encountered I also realize in hindsight that nearly everyone I've ever associated with has been either neurodivergent or neurodivergent-adjacent Autism ADHD ADD Schizophrenia Schizo-Affective Bipolar NPD BPD OCD Tic syndrome Tourette syndrome CPTSD PTSD victims of abuse etc TRIGGER WARNING PLEASE ALSO BEWARE THAT THIS WHOLE POST CONSISTS OF RECOUNTING EXPERIENCES OF ABUSIVE BEHAVIOUR DRUG ABUSE amp INFIDELITY CERTAINLY NOT THE MOST DETAILED I COULD HAVE GOTTEN BUT STILL PROCEED WITH CAUTION Hello all I'll attempt to keep this concise My disjointed thinking patterns may have other plans so bear with me I know this is a sub dedicated to cannabis cessation However struggling with a psychological dependency like this is frequently associated with other mental issues so I hope some of you can understand where I'm coming from with this post I feel I need to paint the full picture to properly convey what I'm dealing with Yes the crux of this post is about my cannabis dependency Please bear with me as I set the scene I would really appreciate any guidance or advice I don't have many people left in my life to turn to I feel it s important to note that I don t believe most of this toxic behavior I m about to describe is intentionally malicious it seems to me it s mostly from a lack of ability to self-examine one s own behavior and basically acting through the lens of trauma-driven reactions as well as very stubborn black-and-white views Not to mention this sort of generational trauma seems to clearly be far-reaching back through the generations of my family I grew up in a fundamentalist literalist Baptist Christian conservative household as an undiagnosed autistic and ADHD riddled child Both of my parents are almost certainly adhd autistic or a combination of both I grew up being constantly emotionally neglected dismissed invalidated for my emotions scolded and punished for things I didn t even understand were wrong and sometimes they weren t My Dad had developed narcissistic tendencies himself from his childhood so I might simply ask him a question about what he had just told me then he would imagine it as a slight against him He paddled me regularly for almost no reason at least from my POV but that s basically as far as the physical abuse went I believe resorting to violence towards children as a means of correcting behavior makes no sense when that kid doesn t even understand your reasoning truly I think it s a pathetic tactic But he was beaten far more than he beat me That s how they d been raised just like their parents before them My research for lack of a better term has revealed that many of my family members are high-masking neurodivergent folks who were above average intelligence but below average emotional intelligence so they ve mostly all white-knuckled through life by becoming abusive narcissists themselves mostly through psychological means Very dysfunctional family yet somehow most of us have stuck together Except my uncle who is also very likely undiagnosed AuDHD and has MS and probably a grocery list of other issues In fact if there were one person in my family I would bet on being in this same boat as me it s him And I m reasonably certain about my parents and grandfather I mean I see them nearly every day Recently it s become apparent that my uncle s wife was an abusive manipulative cheater with a childhood full of abuse which made her attachment style very volatile she was probably never compatible with monogamy But she was also very vulnerable and easily coerced as was my undiagnosed uncle as he struggled with similar issues This was also still during a period in time where single-income households were far more common-place So my uncle became an engineer and his wife became a stay at home mom It seems it had been a relatively toxic co-dependent type relationship right from the beginning and recently it s come out that she was cheating on him the whole time when he found out he had been so brainwashed by religion that he was convinced he couldn t divorce her and so she convinced him to join her in a polygamous sex cult basically So at least in his mind he was forced to choose between rejection being shunned by his whole social network being rejected by the church or watching the supposed love of his life get fucked by scores of men who were physically superior to him right in front of him Then she ran off with his business partner last year No I do not think he was a cuckold purely by choice That desire just isn't in him He has a vast inferiority complex that made him suffer through those abuses for years in response he became very financially abusive towards her exert control over her Do I think he made all the correct decisions No Do I think his concerns were valid Yes absolutely My family s strict adherence to a literalist interpretation of the whole bible would be perplexing if I didn t realize most of my family members are plagued with this total obsession and need for order and justice coupled with their intense fear of the unknown I guess what I wonder is the following How can you end up as anything except for a narcissistic monster when that s how you ve been made to feel for your entire life anyways At that point it s easy to see why someone might decide they may as well reap the rewards if they're being punished for it regardless The reason I bring this is up is this I relate to this man immensely He struggles reconciling his own emotions with understanding others intentions he burned many bridges unintentionally unknowingly he alternates between being hypo-emotional and hyper-emotional he comes across as self-absorbed and he has a diminished network of friends and families as a result of his efforts to avoid that exact situation How else could this have played out though He's had no support for his issues besides empty words from people who truly didn t care or understand Christians have very unique ways of invalidating your struggles and I ve experienced most of it myself Religious manipulation gaslighting ostracization coercion shaming group-think etc I ve become convinced churches attract greater concentrations of both the abused and the abusers and unfortunately many of these individuals are both Myself included As a kid I was very emotional had outbursts had difficulty focusing etc but I was also hyperlexic quick-witted and picked up writing math and art significantly quicker than the majority of my classmates who were already almost a year older than me As I progressed through elementary and then in to middle school I managed to attract multiple abusive friendships as I wasn t properly equipped to even detect this kind of behavior as negative I interpreted it as confident or bold or cool somehow At some point during this time I had a couple of moments of public embarrassment due to emotional dysregulation and outbursts I hated the negative attention and became obsessed with never eliciting such a reaction again I intentionally made my biggest bully into my best friend so that I could re-direct his abusive tendencies towards others I then adapted his approach of belittling and intimidating people weaker than me in to being my own little buddy sidekick I was never physically abusive like my so-called friend had been but I was manipulative and opportunistic In retrospect I suspect my childhood-bully turned friend was living in an abusive home himself Turns out when his older brother was 11 and his younger sister was 8 the former molested the latter I just I don t think literal children are all that likely to learn or view that type of behavior as normal for no reason Nothing happens in a vacuum The sister didn t seem to even understand what had been done to her until years later as she had confided in me when I was secretly dating her behind my friends back I really did like her but I knew her brother wasn t the most emotionally sound person so I thought it best to keep it under wraps until we had decided to date for real But when my friend found out about us he quite literally physically assaulted me picked me up over his head effortlessly slammed me to the ground over a large tree root and choked me until I nodded in agreement with him telling him I would never speak to his sister again and I didn t Did I mention that this was in the Christian-school directly adjacent to the church we attended My whole life was contained within that one property I hadn t even believed in organized religion since I was like 11 or 12 so when I was 16 I finally got the courage up to switch to a public school so I could stop being forced to comply with shit I simply didn t agree with My Dad threatened to ground me indefinitely and take away my electronics shitty blackberry simply for wanting a public school education and to not be forced to church events and Sunday school every weekend So I threatened calling CPS and I was dead serious I never budged and they finally caved in and sent me to public school for Grades 11 and 12 In addition to being ADHD ASD I accumulated a lot of behavioural disorders due to maladaptive coping mechanisms masking my struggles OCD Anxiety MDD BPD NPD I think you get the idea I went from being a gifted kid in line to skip a grade to a withdrawn depressed anti-social pre-teen very quick and picked up marijuana at 15 years old At first it seemed to help in moderation with small doses but then I went through my first serious break-up shortly after and still had to see her every day in class I was a basket case Running off to the bathroom to cry in between classes that went on for months Look I know this almost certainly TMI but I feel that it's necessary to illustrate just what an intense attachment to cannabis I've developed I began using daily selling my belongings walking hours across town just for a dime bag Just for a brief relief from the ruminations of rejection and inadequacy that had been ignited by this breakup It was basically the result of me being too open with this girl I had taken my mask off for the first time and she was horrified She ghosted me over christmas break after dating and seeing each other every day for a year I genuinely didn't understand why at the time but it may be worth noting that I had later realized my friend had intentionally played both of us against each other in order to sow miscommunication and mistrust because he felt superior to me and didn t want me in a relationship when he wasn t I was never able to properly process these emotions I could never reconcile who was wrong or right I just repressed all of it Went back to being emotionally numb and thats when at 16-17 I began acting like a full-blown narcissist I had realized marijuana was deterring me from reaching my full potential socially so I quit cold-turkey somehow and replaced it with booze and cocaine up until 19-20 years old I got a full time job straight of highschool just so I could make the payments for a 2006 Mustang GT and play the role of a confident-extrovert It worked at least in the short term During these couple of years I had successfully dated a half-dozen girls or so casually without ever having grown an emotional attachment to any of them then at 19 I met a girl whom I believed I had immediately fallen in love with at first sight Anyone know what the term limerence means I didn t at the time I did any and everything within my power to win her over I would play whichever role she needed me to Around 6 months into the relationship I had accidentally missed a dose of the anti-depressant I had been taking for maybe the past year or two at that point Thinking about it now that s probably what helped me stop cannabis from coalescing in to a full blown dependency the first time around Well I had gotten so dizzy while driving to work from missing my medication that I had to pullover and wait for my mom to deliver it to me on the side of the road This experience re-awakened my fear of inadequacy This girl I had been dating was literally one of the most beautiful girls in town she literally had 2000 followers on Instagram as a 17-year-old high school senior in 2013-2014 Trust me that was a lot more impressive back then especially when almost all her followers were local to our mid-sized town I felt in this moment on the side of the road that I was ashamed to be physically dependent on such a chemical to just keep my shit together I convinced myself she deserved better than that and that I didn t need to be taking this medication I was wrong My behavior immediately spiraled out of control and only a few short weeks later I crashed my Mustang GT into a parked car after overdosing on Ketamine Ironic that Ketamine was how I put my Mustang out to pasture no This marked the beginning of the end between us she became incredibly mean and vindictive she lost respect for me began policing my behavior dragging my name through the mud literally airing out all of our dirty laundry in the pubic sphere and then publicly humiliated me by attempting to cuckold me basically During the last month or two of our relationship she had been trying to punish me for embarrassing her by embarrassing me 10-fold She showed a chain of texts to me between her and her new male co-worker that was essentially just them sexting each other straight up Not once did she ever appear to care about my well-being yes I had initially lied to her about my drug-use but it was simply out of shame and the fear of rejection I recognize it was wrong but it wasn t malicious then she showed me a whole other side to her that was incredibly cruel and callous It was clear she only cared about how I had affected her reputation not about my mental well-being She didn t care why she only saw me as weak and unworthy now That s when I realized I had mostly been used as a means to further boost her social status and I no longer served any purpose She had tried to string me along as long as she could while she held auditions for her next boyfriend Before she could do that I told her I was done and went and slept with the prettiest girl I could in order to make her jealous Pretty sure it worked but my God I did not think that all the way through She turned around and fucked half the guys in my grad class and tried to describe their cocks to me when we crossed paths at a party the following year and I fell further and further in to drug abuse and hedonism than ever before I tried to fill the void with meaningless sex transactional relationships material objects and so on Nothing helped and eventually I found that reintroducing cannabis into my life made more sense It made it easier for me to avoid harder substances as well as risk-taking tendencies And since I had now essentially given up on the concepts of love trust social status self-respect friendship etc I just kept withdrawing further and further into myself I became physically dependent on Xanax in 2018 and ran out of them suddenly after 2 months of constant use with no means of re-supplying while I was in the middle of a 8-day shift working at a remote camp site I had a full-blown panic attack started seeing stars having mild visual hallucinations I went to have a shower so I could chill out and then the building had a power surge In this same moment I went into a withdrawal-induced seizure was subsequently boated back to land then had another seizure was evacuated by helicopter to a larger hospital that was 400km away and woke up 2 days later from a medically induced coma Not super relevant but I just wanted to note that waking up after a 2 day coma to a pretty nurse your own age removing a catheter from your dick hole is not a vibe Anywaaays about 2 years after going fully off the deep end again I had been diagnosed with ADHD as a 21 yr old and now that Ive turned 28 I have been aware I'm likely autistic for about a year and have sought out counsel to that end Ive been told by specialists that more tests are warranted as they feel there is a strong likelihood that I am Of course this wouldnt be covered under my MSP I'm Canadian if that matters and it's insanely expensive and I'm up to my eyeballs in debt so I can't move forward with that until I can afford to Genuinely considering personal bankruptcy At the beginning of the pandemic I had another mental breakdown which manifested as me losing my job falling out with my best friend roommate falling heavily back in to drug use this time intentionally abusing fentanyl-laced heroin hoping I would just fall asleep and not wake up but that thankfully never happened I eventually had a moment of clarity and decided I needed to separate myself from my previous lifestyle so I moved back to my parents city and have been living in their basement the past two years while I struggle to re-train and move my way back in to another career path as we slowly re-build our relationships with a better understanding of ourselves and each other Anyways all this to say that I am and have been in a very volatile headspace for a long time I've obsessively self-harmed intentionally overdosed sought out dangerous situations left and right crashed my muscle car and absolutely kamikazed my reputation This is all long in the past now but I also engaged in petty theft shoplifting car-hopping picking fights creating enemies I know it sounds stupid but I've realized recently it was all an unheard cry for help that only succeeded in further entrenching my narcissistic tendencies and alienating my remaining social ties In fact I had repressed my emotions so completely that I hadn t cried for a few years at one point and was starting to suspect I might just be a sociopath And that s how I wanted it to be I viewed emotions as an obstacle to overcome not something to work through And I realize now that the way I ve been dismissive towards other people emotions had been a coping mechanism as I've never felt able or allowed to fully express my own emotions And so I'm only just now beginning to develop emotional intelligence in earnest I ve been attending therapy in varying forms for a couple of years now I haven t engaged in many of my worst tendencies from the past But I did find myself in a very disorganized negative headspace a few times recently and compulsively pocketed some small items at work I felt like shit afterwards but I can t afford to risk losing employment and I knew that I had already gotten away with it It wasn t premeditated but I saw an opportunity when I was in the security systems blind spot how did I know this Well some habits are harder to break than others I have been programmed throughout the years to always be searching for opportunity to exploit It s one of the things I hate most about myself but my emotional state can be so varied that sometimes I simply do not care in the moment Anyways back to the core of my issues Cannabis seems to be both the poison and the cure for me It was the single most effective means of quitting nicotine booze cocaine xanax heroin etc But it also leaves me as a husk of my former self Thouugh if I m honest I can t even really separate my true personality from the mask I ve grown so accustomed to After not engaging with cannabis for a a period of time my hyperactive tendencies become more intense but I become seemingly more emotionally regulated up to a point though I m not sure that this accurately reflects my emotional state I think I just become more energized focused and capable of putting back up this false front then at some point I become too confident Maybe just too bored for my own good and inevitably convince myself that this time will be different and that I won t get carried away And then I always do After a period of weeks or even months of consecutive use it slowly depletes the dopamine in my mind until I start to fall back in to old cyclical thought patterns of obsessive rumination rejection and paranoia The first couple of days are always pure bliss and then it slowly slides back towards dysphoria from euphoria But by this point I ve already reignited my dependance on the substance and I know that if I stop I will be unable to focus sleep or eat properly for up to several days in a row following discontinuation of my use And that doesn t bode well for being able to make it to whichever job or appointment I have the following day So I just keep kicking the can down the road until I m so frazzled from my cannabis use that I have another emotional crisis and stop for a short period of time only to once again find myself in this over-confident almost manic state of mind that inevitably leads to me making risky half-baked decisions As a means of redirecting this over the years I ve realized I could override this tendency by over-consuming cannabis instead It was definitely a form of harm reduction and it definitely was effective in some sense But now I feel that I m caught in this same cycle with just strictly cannabis It starts out as a means to quell my ever-increasing desire for excitement but I always overcompensate and come back out the other side once again profoundly depressed and anxious I think of most people s live as following a symbolic straight line with varying degrees of deviation some with the odd bit of curvature maybe to account for straying a little off their path and then there s me my line is a fucking zig zag that demonstrates every time I try to change my behavior I greatly over-correct or over-compensate Sometimes this leads to me developing new problems sometimes I just swap one for another equally shitty problem What I recognize is that cannabis is making it more difficult for me to break away from this pattern in the long-term but in the short-term it does seem to be my only respite from otherwise living in what is basically permanent discomfort I wish Canada did not legalize cannabis I know it s been a net positive most likely but I m selfish and I don t need the increased access to it I literally cannot escape it Please advise lt 3 Looking For Advice Maybe Just Some Understanding,autism
1228,People have taken advantage of me all my life and I m just beginning to understand the root cause I m on the autism spectrum and I also have low verbal comprehension Social interaction is tough I m often confused and I usually feel like I ve come away from an interaction with missing details and a lack of understanding for how everything fits together I was diagnosed on the spectrum about 10 years ago but only recently has it really hit me how much my low verbal comprehension has effected my life I don t think I would have noticed the depths of this problem if it were not for my heavy trauma symptoms ripping away my mask and leaving me little to function with In certain times in my life when things were going well I didn t have much reason to dive into the details of my verbal comprehension But now my mask is failing big time and I can see what s underneath At first the realization felt hopeless but after thinking a bit this feels like a puzzle piece I ve been looking for all my life This is one of those things that s hard to admit to myself and I think thats why I kept myself from noticing I remember events different than other people do People have called me a liar and untrustworthy due to my inability to understand For most of my life I knew there was something different there but it felt dangerous to look into It was a truth that I did not want to uncover I put my energy into art I knew I needed a career where verbal communication was not essential But surprise surprise even with art there s a certain amount of verbal communication required to be successful My last job fell apart due to my trauma response and also just realizing now that low verbal comprehension played a big role I actually started to think that maybe I m a misanthropist because of my distaste of being around people Talking and connecting is really difficult and my experience is often not fun I have a persistent feeling that people are trying to trick me and deceive me I get the feeling that people are being sneaky with me but just now realizing that those feelings are the result of my low verbal comprehension Honestly just crazy thinking about bad times in my life and seeing how my communication ability has influenced me I wasn t really afraid to ask for help just mostly scared that I didn t have a good reason to ask for help Afraid that people would turn me away because my requests seemed silly Things got really bad over this last year My roommate didn t understand trauma or autism When my trauma response kicks in hard I hyperventilate He felt threatened by my heavy breathing and threatened to call police on me because of it A lot of other things that also made my trauma worse Just crazy crazy crazy Severe trauma symptoms now are bringing back very visceral and sharp memories and bodily sensations This is gonna sound weird but in a way I think my really bad trauma symptoms lately are necessary to dig into the things my mind had buried My ability to function is extremely limited and it feels like my life is falling apart In my current mental state I have an awareness of my trauma that I didn t have when things were happier Just really really painful though Been having so much difficulty speaking due to trauma I m writing instead of speaking With writing I have so much more clarity of mind Speaking just feels like a jumble When I speak I feel like I m an actor playing the role of myself Throughout my life most of my social interactions felt fake Now I think that I was in the fawn part of the trauma response for those interactions I learned to fit in well enough but I really think that speaking itself is part of my masking and the person people thought they knew as my true self was actually me in trauma response I think most a my own verbal communication is a mask that I developed for survival needs Also realizing just how confusing facial expressions are for me If I look at someones face while they re talking it s just too much information The face and the voice feel like disjointed bits of information My brain just goes haywire trying to figure out the face and the voice together I ve been looking away when people are talking and that helps greatly in lessening sensory overload The story of my life is me doing things wrong and people getting angry at me Seems like I could never win no matter how hard I tried I ve turned my back on so many people because the only emotion I felt from them is anger and contempt toward me It s such a hard thing to deal with to be criticized when you don t understand the root cause I thought I d done something really bad or thought that I was really bad I tried over and over but improvements where hard because underneath it all I really couldn t tell what people were asking of me I failed over and over People blamed me and I now have a huge self worth problem I don t feel like I have much self worth because people were always getting after me for misunderstanding I felt really flawed I ve isolated myself because I felt no one could understand this part of myself Bad bad times over these last 3 years People were wondering why I didn t make different choices and all I really have to say is that my mental framework of the situation was based in verbal communication deficits so I acted on what I thought to be the case This thing with my low verbal comprehension runs deep Very bad emotions in many situations People getting really upset with me because they thought that I understood the situation but I was just making my best guesses I feel so alone with this like I m undeserving of help I do try to ask for help sometimes but I usually get turned away or people refuse to help because they think I should be able to do it myself It looks simple to them but they can t see that I m not even understanding the situation That is so painful People say I should learn to ask for help but then those same people abandon me thinking that I m just acting entitled when I actually don t understand what s going on Such painful painful memories To make matters worse I can come across as fairly articulate in certain situations When I talk about one of my interests I can communicate well I really think this confuses people In some situations I seem smart so to them it doesn t make sense that I wouldn t pick up on basic communication in other situations I continually get the impression that people think I m trying to pull one over on them People won t help me or they ignore me because they think I m lazy and should be able to do it myself I think people view helping me as enabling lazy behavior Just so frustrated with my life and afraid that people won t help because they can t imagine that I could misunderstand the things that I have I m really struggling right now in my life I lost trust in everyone No one to turn to because no one could understand what was really going on No one could really see my struggles with sensory overload and my struggles with understanding communication It s just today that I connected things together enough to realize all this I m really hoping that with this new knowledge I ll start seeing more options When you don t know what s wrong it s hard to find a solution My life is falling apart due to low verbal comprehension,autism

1235,I was diagnosed AuDHD level 2 in 2023 It was really important to me to understand myself my history why I am the way I am It was a bittersweet diagnosis I grieved the person I thought I was but embraced the person I am I m learning skills in therapy and changing a lot My husband and I had a conversation yesterday about his childhood He hasn t told me much about it despite us being together for 6 years and married for 3 I know he moved himself half way across the world at 17 years old and basically reinvented himself altogether He was bullied as a child by kids at school His bedroom was in the attic He had his toys lined up perfectly and would panic meltdown if anyone came in his room or touched moved his things He said he was genuinely happy spending time alone playing with his train set He would get toys for gifts and the first thing he would do is take them apart to see how they work and put them back together Even to this day his pride and joy is his toolbox It is gigantic and immaculate Every single tool has a specific place they are perfectly clean without a single smudge and he can tell you from memory exactly which drawer and where everything is It is actually so impressive to me I asked if he had special interests or hyperfixations If he would talk too much about them if people thought he was annoying or told him to shut up that s my ADHD being projected I think He said he was practically non verbal I asked how his parents felt about it all apparently they were just happy he was keeping out of trouble His evolution saw him living independently at a young age and he began working in workshops as an apprentice mechanic Those environments are rife with toxic masculinity and he took on a lot of behaviours and attitudes that align with that I fell in love with him because I saw through that He was kind sweet hard working hugely intelligent excellent with his hands don t be dirty and an amazing problem solver I see him for the little boy I believe he was not the toxic man he grew into He s still that little boy when he s with me he just transforms in different environments depending on who he is around and what he thinks they expect him to be It s caused us some problems in our marriage which we are working hard on We re in individual therapy as well as couples counselling We ve had some really important in-depth conversations lately where I m getting to know him better than ever and the truth is I do love him very much I m not here for marriage or relationship advice nor criticism in this regard I guess I just want some perspective As someone who was recently diagnosed and whose diagnosis is very personally important for my growth and understanding I can t help but project that onto him I don t want to pressure him to get diagnosed or even identify as autistic if it just doesn t feel right for him or if it makes him uncomfortable But I also feel that if he is autistic it s potentially a huge factor in why we fell in love in the first place and feel so safe together Part of me does want him to seek diagnosis and explore this part of his life and personality to realise that he can be loved and happy exactly for who he is and so he can love himself He doesn t need that toxic masculinity he doesn t need to force himself into uncomfortable social situations he can be and do exactly what he wants to be I know I m projecting I don t want to put too much pressure on him I don t want to dictate his identity in any way It s just what I feel is the truth and I don t know what to do with it I m interesting in your thoughts but please be kind we re in a difficult place at the moment but we re trying Thank you I m 95 sure my husband is autistic but he doesn t want to know about it,autism
1236,As a child I was very hyperactive Not that I liked to communicate with many people no I never had many friends I mean that I could jump a lot scream and sometimes even hit furniture I didn't think it was weird before as many children behave the same way but the fact is that some of the things I did as a child I still do now and it bothers me For example sometimes I suddenly want to scream or say something or sometimes I want to do something with my hands most often hit the table and also I often can't do one thing and do several things at once because it helps me feel safe or something like that Is there any chance that I could be autistic,autism
1237,Sometimes you feel that everyone is upset with you If you live at home you're lift is limited and controlled by your parrent I'm not going to lie but I'm 36 and I live at home with my mom and sometimes I feel that she limits me like the mother from the movie The Waterboy LOL I've had felt from time to time that everyone is mad at me My mom said that's not true and that's my autism amp x200B Does anyone else feel this way,autism

1239,I know this is a problem all autistic people face but I could really use some advice I'm like a mix of Wednesday Addams and Bart Simpson I like gore and say stuff that makes me seem like a sadist a lot I wouldn't actually hurt anyone Plus sometimes I'll think of something funny and start laughing and can't explain what I thought of because it's usually the most random thing ever And I do say really stupid things and ask stupid questions can't focus etc And I interrupt people without meaning to say words out of order say stuff I really shouldn't I'm also very active I move around fidget a lot which a lot of people seem to think is disrespectful And I don't listen I want to but there's so much going on plus my own thoughts and I just cannot focus on what the person is saying The biggest thing is interrupting people someone will be in the middle of their sentence and I will have something I really want to say and it'll just come out and be like a full on speech If anyone has advice I'd appreciate it How do I stop acting inappropriately in social situations,autism
1240,I'm just wondering when you knew you were different from other people For me it was when I joined actual school my parents home schooled me after preschool and I couldn't do the stuff other kids could I was in 3rd grade What age did you know you were different,autism
1241,This is a humorous post that I'm making out of hunger and boredom I normally live alone but I am spending a couple months renting a room in a shared house with my friends It's been lovely but yesterday we were at the cinema with a group of people and I very suddenly and completely ran out of social battery My autistic friend noticed and I let my housemates know that I have reached my limit on consecutive days of human contact and I would be going into gremlin mode so not to worry or try to get me to come out of my room Today I slept until 4 pm mildly worried about burnout went out with my dog and then had a cup of tea in the kitchen while my autistic friend housemate was making herself food wearing headphones so at no risk of conversation I haven't had any food yet today at all I just got up and took my dog out to run then had a shower I started to get really hungry and was making myself a soup amp sandwich My other housemate came in turned on all the big ceiling lights and started to sweep the kitchen while two of us were cooking and also changing all the bin bags and stuff I became extremely overwhelmed and left all my cooking as it was and quickly went into my room to put on my headphones I checked a couple times to see when they'd leave the kitchen so I could keep cooking It has been a while they were still there talking and doing stuff Now I checked again and there is more people in the house And they're all in the kitchen talking and laughing I have accepted my fate of dying a slow but cozy hunger death in my bed Doomed to starve in my room due to people being in the kitchen,autism
1242,I have never lived anywhere longer than 2 years As a child it was because of my dads job I hated always being the new guy having to say goodbye to my friends just as we were getting to really be close having my room constantly be in a state of disorder because as soon as I found a place for everything my organization system was upset and we had to pack up again new schools and new neighborhoods My older brother who has autism but is considered the savant type and seems normal aside from really hating social interaction was never bothered by it He loved the opportunity for adventure meanwhile by the time I was twelve I was all adventured out It made me really lonely and felt like there was no sense of stability or anything As an adult I am still forced into that lifestyle In spite of being androgynous and unattractive I seem to draw in stalkers if I m in one place too long Having mobility issues from medical malpractice as well as autism makes me a sitting duck for anyone who wants to mug jump me or do even worse The cops seldom take me seriously restraining orders are bogus as fuck so I just move Moving this often is even more obnoxious as an adult I hate having to go through the process of packing and unpacking changing my address finding new doctors getting a new job and changing my health insurance so often It s exhausting A lot of neurotypicals say they envy me because since I moved out I ve constantly been on the run They say they think my lifestyle is fun and exciting Wow your life is like an action movie I wish mine was exciting as yours Little do they know that I d happily make a deal with the devil if it meant I could safely settle down I m actually a pretty boring person and if the American dream was still remotely attainable for an ugly androgynous autistic person with a messed up spine that d be all I d want Living in a small modest house in a small town with a spouse if anyone not murdery and emotionally mature ever showed real interest in pursuing a serious relationship with me getting a dog together and working somewhere with regular hours is really all I want from life Unfortunately with the way things have been going I m not confident that ll happen My entire life is probably going to be exactly as it is now but I can t imagine living the rest of my life like this and I don t know if it s autism or what Is hating a nomadic lifestyle an autism thing,autism

1244,I live in a rather backwards area I'll be honest Vegan options are few and far between so naturally I turned to BK as they had the biggest selection I absolutely loved their vegan nuggets and they slowly became a comfort food for me If I had a particularly shitty day I'd order some and just forget about the world So imagine my disappointment when I finish work and have a hankering for these little crunchy pieces of fun-ness tonight only to realise that they've vanished from the menu I scoured the internet and learned that some stores have stopped stocking them Now I'm sad and nuggetless Yes I could learn to make them myself but that takes time out of my already small amount of free time that I get each night Anyway rant over Going to just cook something at home I guess A restaurant I frequent got rid of my favourite meal and I'm legit devastated,autism

1246,I struggle so much with time management ty to my adhd but I'malways at time when I need to go somewhere I ficking hate being late it's an horror for me Now I'm fucking upset because we missed the train and our last option the bus Now we have to wait the next train Since I live with my girlfriend I can't anymore rely on my superpower I fucking lost the ability to be late when I left home and being on time when I need to go My time management suck but it was always like that and I rarely had issue but now I just can't adapt We are living together since June and I can't adapt my fucking poor time management We are always on the fucking extreme edge and there we are Missing the fucking train because I can't fucking adapt I fucking hate being late,autism
1247,I had supervision today at work It's meant to be a regular occurrence But never really had them under my old boss Well I did a stress assessment as I asked to be referred to occupational health and as part of it I said how I was struggling because I think I had burnout earlier in the year and was off work for 2 5 months Part of my issues were home life but the other was my job at the time as I covered someones maternity leave for 12 months and there were major failings because of how I was treated But when I moved back to my old job I expected things to get better mentally but since I was gone we lost 37 hours of admin So there is over 100 hours per week between 2 full time staff when you minus leave that's 66 hours of staffing so not plausible to continue I said that since my burnout things I normally could deal with I can't so a lot of my issues are down to being neuro diverse the upper manager said that she thinks she is neuro diverse and tbh I kinda believe it but my new manager said we're all a little neuro diverse on the spectrun Now I'm still waiting on my assessments for ADHD and Autism But already confirmed I have Dyslexia and Irlens But I feel this comment is rather insulting esp coming from a manager who should know better Now I'm wondering if i should mention to her nicely why saying that phrase is not appropriate Or maybe send her someones YouTube video or an article But as she is already having issues with my colleague and I both majorly struggling at work because of work pressures so wondering if I should give her the benefit of the doubt and ignore it this time Got told by my new boss everyone is a little neuro diverse,autism

1249,Everything that needs improvement in my review is 100 autism ADHD and OCD I'm at a loss I need to set new goals for the year but all I want do do right now is disappear Today is my first day back and I'm just sitting at my computer alternating between meltdowns and anxiety attacks My manager says I can improve everything in like 2 weeks None of the things listed on my review are 2 week improvement things I can't tell if this is ableism or misunderstanding I'm not in a place to switch jobs right now unless it's forced on me and life responsibilities are too prominent my rent is 3000 a month If it's forced it would be 3 months from now for them to process my layoff Any advice would be greatly appreciated Feedback Be less emotional Focus more Work on things for your team and not side projects but I use side projects to focus on my main project Don't be upset when we take away your passion projects Communicate better Write less Think before speaking The list continues It's embarrassing How have you recovered after receiving a needs improvement review at work,autism

1253,BTW I usually post on r aspergers but this post got the moderator approvel wait so being desperate I came here instead I know you're thinking I should see a therpaist but I know what I truly need is close friends I can always be with as I always feel so alive when I get good social contact however there's a bunch of things that have denied this I'll split them up so you don't have to read the whole thing if its too much First there's stuff out of my control where people I used to be close to move on for various reasons which has made me think life is pointless if everyone is temporary and I'm not close to anyone this is one reason why I've become so motivated to get married even though I've never been in a relationship at 25 Then there's probably the main thing which is myself I don't get humans to the point I don't even think I am one I see people everywhere establish themselves as being ok with whatever then all of a sudden they're not ok with it or I make one tiny mistake and they think I'm an asshole and never wanna see me again when I meant nothing of the sort One time I got unfriended by someone who was really nice and understanding of me as I asked them the same question I had before on a fb post about what they were doing on some holiday and I guess they thought I was spamming them when I was actually doing EXACTLY as everyone had told me and was asking them about their life to start a friendly chat Other times I say stuff like how is this person going or its been a while I'd love to talk to this person again and I get told I'm creepy Its like no matter what I do I'm either seen as self-centered or only centered on someone else and considered a creep On one discord server I had a convo with someone about something to do with them which amazed people as I was having a proper interesting convo for once I tried to repeat that on another server and everyone was like ThEy DoN't WaNt To TaLk AbOuT tHaT wItH yOu BlOcK hIm and then on another sub someone said how entitled are you to think blocking someone is harsh If only they knew Other people have given up on me and walked away or banned me from discord servers though a couple times I got banned for reasons I know damn well were stupid and not my fault its like a vicious cycle where I keep trying to find people to talk to and when I'm happy I can finally relax which results in them seeing me be me and not liking it With people trying to help me its like theres a barrier bewteen me and them so they can see what I can't and I can see what they can't so neither of us can truly understand the other and the problem continues as they think I'm ignorant And when I'm in such a low mood from all this realising I suck and everyone dislikes a lot of things about me it sucks the life out of me and so I can't move on On social media and irl I see and hear of everyone else getting up to far more than me so I feel so left out even though I know their lives aren't flawless and they may have even more issues than me but the fact they get more social life is what I envy I've been feeling really down about how my autism is a barrier between me and others,autism
1254,Hi everyone I am an AuDHD marriage and family therapist residing in California Last year I decided to develop the curriculum for a 12 week support group for autistic adults that covers topics like burnout masking meltdowns shutdowns sensory processing difficulties friendships dating sex accommodations and self-advocacy I ve now had the pleasure of running 4 sections of my group both in person and virtual where I asked for feedback at the end in order to modify and fine tune the group s topics and structure and after taking a few months off I m excited to share that I am going to be running my group again in the next month or two If you are looking for more community with fellow autistic folks who get it this is your place anyone 18 or older may join group tends to have a wide range of age groups varying from 18-60 Each group runs for 90 minutes once per week will likely run Tuesdays or Thursdays 5 00-6 30 pm PST and the group rate is 50 session I do offer limited sliding scale spots for those who need it so if financial means are a barrier to accessing group just send me a message and we can work something out If anyone is interested in joining please send me a message with your email and I will follow up with you regarding start dates and more information If you are local to San Diego and are interested in joining the upcoming in-person section of my group Wednesdays 5 00-6 30 pm let me know Autism Support Group for Adults Virtual and in-person,autism
1255,I m 25F My mother had me young my nana helped my mother raise me and my father was not in the picture until I was 15 From what I understand during the assessment they the psychotherapist or psychiatrist will get information from someone who knew them when they were a child Which means they will speak to my mother who will inevitably lie and say she seen no signs when I was a child teenager and describe me as the exact opposite of who I actually was to make herself look like a good parent because in her eyes an Autistic daughter would mean she did something wrong Which is not the case but she won t do further research or hear me out regarding masking or about anything regarding the topic of Autism I know she will lie during that assessment Meanwhile I explain all the same research to my nana she actively listens asks questions that were directed toward herself and ends our conversation with Maybe I m Autistic I laughed because after everything I ve learnt about Autism it wouldn t surprise me if she was on the spectrum But my nana s input during the assessment won t matter as much as my mother s would especially if my mother lies and counters what my nana and I both have to say My dad won t be much help either Is it worth it even trying to get an assessment diagnosis Is it worth it for me to try and get a diagnosis when I know my mother will lie during the assessment,autism

1257,I have a near constant stim of picking at the skin on my hands and fingers It becomes a problem for me because I climb and play guitar but I can never let my callouses fully form because as soon as they appear I immediately pick at them and peel them off I also pick at my cuticles and the skin around my nails and have given myself fairly bad hangnails a number of times I want to redirect this urge to something that isn't my skin but I haven't figured out how to do it I have some spinny fidget rings that I like but it doesn't totally satisfy the impulse because it's not quite the same I find myself picking at my skin even when I'm wearing it I don't think it satisfies the sensation of picking and peeling so I'm looking for stim or fidget toys that will but I've never heard of one that seems like it would do what I'm looking for Fidget toys to stop picking at fingers,autism
1258,To me one message of the movie is how religion can have a bad influence when it is taken literally Autistic people are particularly exposed The movie resonates with me because I've also experienced many embarrassing moments from taking preaching too literally SPOILERS BELOW The movie starts with a 19th century Jewish wife killing an old visitor because she believes the mythology and concludes that he is a dybbuk undead Larry Gopnik the main character always tries to live his life as a good person in a naive sense He never lies selflessly helps everyone to his own detriment and doesn't want to hurt anyone When life goes desperately downhill he turns to religion for answers In my opinion Larry although not widely mentioned in the reviews is autistic usually they mention only his brother Arthur But Larry is brilliant at maths and physics has a very naive understanding of the world around him and takes both what people say and religion too literally This makes him an easy target and he's being constantly exploited by everyone around The first rabbi doesn't want to get involved in Larry's personal issues so he just comes up with a generic preaching like it is God's will and get a fresh perspective Of course Larry takes this literally and when he recites the same to his divorce lawyer the lawyer is baffled The second rabbi tells Larry an unrelated story without being helpful Later we find out how the rabbi tells this same story to everyone The third rabbi doesn't even want to see him Larry gets really confused when the Asian student Clive gives him contradictory info about the money and he enters into a paralysis at reporting him He also believed his wife didn't have sex with Clive He doesn't get the hint when Vivienne is flirting with him on the couch and he's just embarrassingly honest there Movie indirectly about autism A Serious Man 2009 spoilers,autism
1259,I'm a late diagnosed AuDHDer and I was raised to be completely unprepared for the world we live in I recently had my cars heat die in the Midwest winter and I live in poverty because disability in this country is a joke The process of finding a car is so unbelievably overwhelming not to mention I can't afford more than a beater I feel like my brains exploding I have no idea what I'm doing I barely know how I'm gonna pay for it I haven't been able to maintain any jobs because the sheet anxiety they produce within me I so wish I could handle a job and make money to buy things But unfortunately I must suffer in oppression Why must this world be so difficult,autism
1260,i love band and all things band it s been in my life since 6th grade and i ve had so many great experiences i m in college now where im majoring in music composition and it s been an incredible experience so far in high school things were a lot different when i first found out about drum majors i knew it was the thing for me they re my special interest i looked up to all of the ones we had my first few years in marching band whenever we went to competitions i would only watch the drum majors it s something im very passionate about to this day but its been really hard to keep trying and trying to be a drum major to no success there were some people in my grade who bullied me and constantly found a way to punch down at me whenever i would gush about anything drum major related i d get called a wannabe and told that i d never be one i tried so hard to prove them wrong but at the end of the day they were the ones who got the position i to this day still feel terrible about it my HS band director was aware about how they treated me but they were still considered over me even worse i was never told what i did wrong i felt like my whole life was ripped apart the people who bullied me were in constant drama and brought the mood of the whole band down since they were in higher positions of power they continued to bully me up until we graduated no one would ever try to stop them not even my band director i tried to stand up for myself but i did it so much that i didn t have the energy anymore i was well aware the journey of becoming a drum major wasn t easy but not like this i love conducting i love being a leader and i love being able to serve the band of course i can do those things without being a drum major but it still feels terrible to have my dreams tossed aside it s been a hindrance i ve tried to get into drum corps this year as a conductor but my lack of experience has gotten me turned down by a few groups i don t have the money time or energy to keep auditioning and being cut so it might not be for me anymore in college i tried out for drum major and even though i didn t make it to the final round i still left a lasting impression with my audition even though i was encouraged by the band director to try out again i don t know if i can keep trying im so unmotivated from my constant failures to get the position previously i wish there was an easier way for me to finally achieve my dream pursuing my passion has been so difficult and it s hard to keep going,autism
1261,Has anyone had success with play therapy for their child with autism Our 5 year old was diagnosed about a year ago She did a combo of speech and OT for about 2 5 years until she started prek in the fall Now she only does speech during her school week In the last year or so we ve noticed her anxiety levels have increased immensely We ve taught her how to identify the feeling of anxiety but we are still struggling on how to help her work through it Her speech has flourished so much within the last year but she still really struggles to be able to pinpoint why she s anxious sad and be able to get past that intense emotion she feels We tried one play therapist and within 15 mins told me since she has autism ABA would be better for her and my gut feeling is that she really does not need ABA So we plan to keep looking for another therapist Play therapy,autism
1262,hey guys this is more of a rant and just a vent because it s hard living with my parents sometimes honestly i have autism as well as some mental health issues as a result and it feels like expressing my problems with this brings them grief specifically my mother she has a hard job anyway that makes her pretty upset some days and my dad is sympathetic to this as well as my issues it s just hard when my mother is seemingly antagonising me for having a disability and taking her bad days out on me verbally i hear her just walking around and clattering clearly frustrated yet she knows loud noises combined with her being agitated is particularly upsetting to me and puts me on edge i don t feel like i can even express myself to her in the limited ways that i can because she s just in a mood it sucks and i feel like i m part of the problem even though i know i m not it s just hard knowing that she seems to think i am all of this while i m trying to have a talk to my father which is about the only thing that could settle me and it couldn t because of the constant sensory input that i just can t take my mind off it sucks feeling like this at home when i m already in a rut about life in general and the state of the world in terms of work i don t know how i m going to cope in a full time job when i already get burnt out trying to function to the degree that most NT people do even without work which is a pretty existentially terrifying idea i m just scared and kind of lonely right now for the future and being around my mother who isn t able to be sympathetic whatsoever and in fact ends up being really agitating is there anything anyone thinks i can do to cope i m trying to get out of the house soon but it s not looking hopeful and i don t want to be stuck here it sucks frankly and i know i m going to melt down because of this eventually thanks in advance to anyone who s read this and anyone who comments how do i cope when my mother isn t being considerate of my needs due to her own,autism

1273,EDIT I know toe walking isn't part of the diagnostic criteria but I'm also researching other traits conditions that commonly appear alongside autism as well For example I have a lot of signs of PDA Hello My friend heavily suspects that I'm on the spectrum she changed my contact name to Tism Twin lol but I'm still Doubtful almost 33F but open so I'm trying to compile all the evidence for and against this before seriously considering possibly pursuing a diagnosis if the evidence for it outweighs against One of the things I'm checking out right now is toe walking I know I did it as a child so much that my mother made a song about it which would just trigger me to run around on my toes like a mad woman we have it on video going to check it for hand flapping too but I know a lot of kids do this I remember occasionally doing it when I was older than 2 but I also have a history of imitating how other people walk if I think it looks cool I did this with one of my new friends in high school and a girlfriend I don't walk all the way on my tip toes my whole foot will touch or skim the ground but the weight is predominantly on my toes I have callouses on both big toes and walking in marching band was Hell because my band director constantly had to correct my walking for the first few weeks of band camp every summer It was easier when I was the drum major because I got to walk backwards and on my toes I also almost always wear 5inch or so heels when not wearing converses that had the smoothest toes so my feet were rarely flat from age 16-30 COVID YAY no more real clothes My heels sometimes ache when I wear flat shoes TL DR So my question is does walking toe to heel essentially count as toe walking or does it exclusively have to be tippy toe only What is considered toe walking,autism

1277,Knowledge I suppose I should clarify I m an autistic person living in Europe I recently graduated with a BA in politics and history But recently I ve noticed many of our peers having successfully learnt new technology languages and encyclopaedia knowledge Mentally I ve never felt so inferior Because it seems I can t retain knowledge of even basic popular culture like song names or any skills hell even spelling and basic skills are inferior Is this unique or is simply because of apathy or lack of intelligence Because it seems rather jarring when I see social media and others with autism who ve had worse severity in their time accomplish so much I know comparison is foolish But I fear being unable to live a person on my own and it s really worrying Thanks for reading Lack of confidence,autism
1278,I m not diagnosed but I suspect I may be on the spectrum I was curious how to know if something is a stim or something that just feels really good Specifically when I listen to music I get really into it and love dancing and get really carried away with the feelings that come with listening to music It almost feels like a flow state and gives me a euphoric feeling if it s the right type of song and idk if this is just a typical flow state that neurotypical people also talk about or if it s maybe a version of stimming And I know I ve seen some people with autism online who use dance as a form of stimming So my question is have you found a way to tell the difference between a comforting stim and just a behavior that feels really good to you or not really How do you know when something is a stim vs just something feeling good,autism
1279,Hi Diagnosed female 27 Diagnosed Nov 2022 after a 3y waiting list but as soon as I went for a referral my GP and mental health nurse told me there and then oh yes you're autistic Not surprised considering I had an assessment as a wee lass back in 1999 when I was semi-mute antisocial hyperlexic and savant but somehow not judged as autistic by the assessor because I didn't have enough support needs or missed milestones in their eyes it was just me being a bit odd and too intelligent Scoff Anyway I work full time in a career job linked to my two degrees I live with my fiance I'm in a shitty town away from all friends and family and have been for 4 years In those four years and especially since the pandemic started which coincides with when I got my diagnostic referral and started unmasking and learning about myself I've gradually been feeling like I've been losing any semblance of empathy and emotional connection to people I like and I'm technically close to friends and family I feel like I go through the motions of what these social relationships should entail but I just don't feel that social connection and if they don't reach out to me then I just don't talk to them And I don't feel close to them Then interests and hobbies and stuff I have exceedingly few because just nothing seems to interest me nothing is fun and I never want to try anything new because I just don't know what I like but I have a list an arm and a leg long of things I don't like I'm so boring and I have nothing to do on my weekends and holidays because I just don't know what to do with my time I just vegetate I'm so tired of wasting my 20s just working and playing video games and nothing else I don't know how to feel connected to people again or how to find interests I'm so closed off from the entire world and everyone in it and I don't know if its depression burnout or if I'm an autistic person with strong schizoid traits I'm on antidepressants dunno if they're doing shit though Depression Burnout Or just onset of schizoid traits,autism

1283,I was labeled autistic in the 1980s and forced segregated in special Ed schools where I wasn't taught Jack and people hit me I let my label hold me back from doing the things I wanted to do although I fought against it like working full time and going to college I did against my professionals orders At age 41 I'm getting my own apartment for the first time which is something they told me I can't do but I'm too old to get pregnant I can't afford IVF even if i did get married I was explicitly told to never marry because the kid would have autism But now that I think about it what's wrong with the kid having autism or being special needs It angers me that the special Ed system PSYOPed me into not shooting my shot with marriage and children Actually I was told never to get married because of the disability penalty but I never knew what that even meant Now that I'm realizing what Neurotypicals took from me I'll never forgive them Feeling like a jerk because I let my label hold me back,autism

1286,Hi I am a 53 year old autistic adult and 2 of my 3 children are autistic For many years I have had a horrified fascination with tattoos and recently toyed with the idea of getting one specifically an autism awareness tattoo I went to the point about 2 years ago of buying a cheap tattoo machine from aliexpress and giving myself a very small where nobody can see it just to see what sort of relationship I would have with it I have only told my wife and a very good confidant who is also autistic A part of me likes it and I'm slowly coming around to the idea that I would like one but am still struggling with the idea of committing to getting a publicly visible one I fear that I would regret the decision but also fear that I am not being true to myself by holding back I know that everyone's experience with autism and with tattoos is unique but would be interested in hearing if any other autistic people who have decided to or to not get one Please no just do it man replies I and probably others would not find this useful Thanks Asking if anyone with experience deciding to get or not get a tattoo,autism
1287,Fairly direct but here's some background I am Always stimming Nonstop and genuinely if I AM truly and completely still it's because I'm forcing it and trust me when I say that gets EXTREMELY uncomfortable after barely a couple seconds My body starts to just wildly shake like a dog that got wet because it just HURTS to be still SOMETIMES it will take a five minute break if the entire body is extremely sore or just running out of energy from always moving and even then once the break is up it's back in motion Frankly a good 90 of the time I don't even notice I'm stimming I do have Autism ADHD and an anxiety disorder so it could be that they're working together But Toe twitching grinding my teeth drumming fingers rocking back and forth wiggling thumbs cracking knuckles flicking wrists wiggling side to side bouncing my legs humming blowing raspberries huffing picking at my nose squirming I could go on and on because I am ALWAYS doing something Fuck the only reason I don't pace more is the fact my right leg is fucked and my hip knee amp ankle joints have chronic pain Even when distracted by other tasks like writing this post while lying on my bed I've got my foot pressed against the one end and pushing me in a forward-backward motion I can't even sit lie in the same position for more than fifteen minutes without getting cramps and discomfort which really peeves my cat off when I push her off or spin around or whatever Sometimes typing on my phone or drawing in my sketchbook or gaming on my Switch counts as a stim and that helps but it's never perfect and often I'm still in motion while doing these things Is this normal Could it be something else Agh Is it normal to ALWAYS stim,autism
1288,i ve thought about the fact that i might have autism for years but i never really looked that much into it i thought it could be adhd or bpd which i guess are commonly mistaken for autism i ve seen this therapist a couple of times but i have a hard time opening up so i don t think i ve ever told her anything of real importance i ve had five therapists in about eight years and none of them have done anything when i tell them about what i think even when i told my last therapist i was having 3-6 panic attacks per day she wouldn t diagnose me or help me get diagnosed for any type of anxiety disorder i guess i m just scared that s she s going to shut me down immediately i don t even know how to go about telling her anything like that though any advice how do i tell my therapist i think i m autistic,autism

1290,So at my mental health peer group there's supposed to be a quiet room for when you need a calm place However Half the time it's populated w people being loud not using headphones but listening to music anyway or loud phone calls or obnoxious behavior I rage quit the group entirely once because I complained to the group leaders and they said they'd address it but it kept happening anyways Anyways At group today It's loud in the main room so I go to the quiet room Someone comes in playing loud music I manage to ask him if he has headphones and he says yes I then politely ask him to use them he says ok and asks if I'm on a phone call I say no I just need quiet He says Ok I'll let you have some peace Feels good man Was finally able to advocate for my sensory needs,autism

1293,Okay so idk if this is a neurotypical thing or just some people I m around But they do this thing when they talk at me and not to me It s not bids for affection either because you ll see someone light up etc that s different I mean when they just make statements and expect me to reply with something Example I was speaking to a family member and they were like I know this guy who owns like sooo many places and I keep asking him to lend me one of the places to do events and stuff but he never commits keep in mind we weren t having a conversation my headphones were also on and I know nothing about event planning or asking people to lend me their real estate So I m like oh that would be cool and then they go yeah his daughter threw a huge party for nye I should ve gone So eventually they keep going on and on again with statements I can t really say anything to Except now I can t not say anything or it ll be rude and also you can see I have headphones so I m actually stuck Idk maybe I m being mean or perhaps the specific person annoys me and maybe that is still a bid for affection But to definitively happens too often to me where I m being forced to be the equivalent of a laughing track in a sitcom in conversations Either way how do I handle this I don t mind changing if it s actually all a me thing Neurotypicals hold me hostage,autism

1296,I don t understand why sign language isn t an automatic part of their early education Instead these little kids are expected and required to haul around these heavy clunky awkward speech devices in their back packs and around their necks that aren t even conducive to creating fluid communication They can push a button with a picture and the device will say the word for them like peanut butter or grandma They aren t very effective or even often utilized in settings outside of the classroom in my experience Why aren t non verbal and severely speech impaired children and their families taught to use sign language to communicate from the start as part of their basic education like deaf children and their families are,autism

1304,Warning Do not read if you are going to do the ados-2 module 4 to test for autism I was diagnosed asd level 1 last year in a private autism clinic but during last months I realized I needed a diagnosis which was also accepted in the public healthcare system in my country so i was referenced to this free initiative to diagnose or test trans people which showed autistic traits or are diagnosed Basically I was very tired because I was tested there in the hospital from the morning with interviews and an IQ test and i stayed there until late afternoon to do the ADOS When I arrived at the ADOS there were two clinicians I was very anxious and the first test was about a puzzle that I had already seen in children's test videos or people that talked it about online The clinician gave me only two pieces and said to complete it with those twos Since there were missing pieces and i remembered about the puzzle thing I was already confused and frustrated tired and asked reciting but very gently Should I ask for more pieces and he gave them to me but not enough This annoyed me a bit although I'm not sure if he noticed and I requested more pieces again Then he asked me what I imagined from the puzzle a tree and what he would have imagined an umbrella beach umbrella Then he showed me a drawing of a crowded beach and asked what sport I would do I said flying an airplane because everything else was on a crowded beach and I didn't like that He asked what sport he would do and I first suggested windsurfing but he said no do I look like someone who would do that Then I suggested golf cus i thought and said he had motor skills issues to not do windsurf and he said no again Finally he said it himself saying it was tennis I was confused because I thought he wouldn't choose tennis since it requires good motor skills They were surprised i could notice some details in the pic Then he asked if I went to the beach with my family when I was little and how a typical day would go i said my parents usually brought me to beaches that weren't crowded like that and only in the morning Then among the questions he tried to talk about himself and made noises like mmhh because he wanted me to respond and ask him questions about himself but I felt uncomfortable and didn't know how to behave I was torn between asking him a question about himself to avoid hurting his feelings or not responding to him It probably didn't change much as i would have probably replies with something about myself and then stop idk since i didn't wanna mask In the end I didn't answer him At that moment I was also thinking on whether I was autistic or not if I had these thoughts Then I froze due to anxiety and couldn't listen to him i literally couldn't and said it so they made me spoke to the other clinician about the interview who started talking about snow in Japan Meanwhile the other clinician started drawing a triangle on the paper for the rest of the ADOS and I was quite hypnotized by this This distracted me from the need to make eye contact Then he gave me a book about flying frogs He narrated part of it in the first few pages and then stopped at a page and asked me if the man eating in the house was American or not I said I had no basis to say it because in my thoughts he could eat bad food even if he wasn't American In the next page the frogs went to an old woman's house and he asked me questions about their facial expressions and those of a cat to which I think responded alright Then he continued with the pages narrating and asking me what was happening the frogs were going against the bedsheets Then he continued narrating and the story ended with flying pigs which I found it funny and laughed I had difficulty with the next story though It was about a fisherman and a cat He gave me four pictures and asked me to tell the story In the first one I said the fisherman was fishing a fish in the second one the fisherman put the fish in a bucket in the third one the cat stole the fish in the fourth one the cat put it in the pelican's mouth and in the fifth one it's not clear why the cat gets angry even though it is seemingly consciously put the fish in the pelican's mouth One clinician pointed out that the cat had a cunning expression and I said that it didn't seem that way to me because I thought it was happy He asked me for the moral of the story and for me it was that both the fisherman and the cat regardless of whether it was cunning or not should be more careful They also asked if there were some hints that could dishern if the cat was owned by the fisherman and I couldn't find it They were surprised i could notice a detail in the pic sequence here too they didnt Then i think he asked me to mime brushing my teeth while explaining it verbally I knew about this too unfortunately I think there was no problem except that I forgot to mention rinsing the mouth Then he asked me questions about how my memory works how I am at work with colleagues what I think about morals marriage whether I prefer to live alone and sensory issues He asked me to describe what falling in love means to me and others some emotions I have had some difficulty with certain emotions Finally he told me a story he made with four objects including a pair of glasses i think to represent a person and a brush that moved and represented a motorbike for him i made a joke about how he has a very nice imagination to think that brush is a motorbike then he asked me to do it without copying him I naturally lined them up diagonally and unlike him I didn't move them and I was very brief I had chosen a pair of glasses engineer a flower a rubber ball pollen and a bucket for me the story was A 20th-century engineer goes to collect pollen from flowers that when ingested allows communication at speeds faster than light Then I got stuck they went silent I wanted to continue but as soon as I opened my mouth to say more details that slowly come to mind they said i was very creative and stop to the test Then after a pause they let me fill a questionnaire called abas where i was really confused and further tired in the communication section I'm pretty sure i actually overstimated myself and it was really hard to answer because the fields were either something like always or sometimes and on most of them i also checked i suppose because they were just hard to answer The psych also told to not put I suppose too much but i did it anyway i was also afraid they were iq related even tho they told my iq is normal My results still have to arrive and i might have to complete other questionares but idk if they are related to autism Im very afraid because of the questionnaire usually the ados misses asd level 1 people and it needs more tests which are like the abas and because i already knew something about the puzzle and the teeth brushing I was told that I didn't had to do those in the adult version by my psychologist so i wasn't worried before that test day and then when they actually made me do that stuff i didn't know what to do and say and just guessed that it didn't matter much but now im worried especially considered it is a one time opportunity Can you give me any advice Advice needed after doing the ados very panicked,autism
1305,I love running it s how I process my emotions best and such But while I love running at home on my treadmill I just can t stand the thought of going outside for a run I tried a few times but what bothers me the people constantly walking past the too hot cold temperatures how I might not be able to use the exact same route due to people or road blocks etc It drives me nuts especially the people I need to run around or avoid somehow because I m trying to focus on myself but then can t cause they distract me It s why I opted for a treadmill eventually but people constantly encourage me to go outside when I can t It s too overwhelming Could this be an autistic thing Can t go running outside an autistic thing,autism

1318,Hello everyone Im someone who have struggled all my life feeling different from others Even inside my family i have felt most of my life like people dont understand me Until recently i didnt know lot about autism or the spectrum I know here people are being super critic about what there is about autism on TikTok and also im sure there is also lot of disinformation But recently some videos made me do alot of research and im still trying to do more But some stuff i see from people who seemed real i felt like oh im not the only one feeling like this I felt like more research i do the more i find maybe im not weird and not only one and there is actually explanation for things what i feel and why some things feel really difficult for me Really I ve always had a feeling like there is something different about me and I learned to mostly fit in with people but meaning im not being myself and it was really difficult when i was teenager Now im coming close to 30 and I have accepted I dont have to be like everyone else Now im thinking should i try to get tested but that feels so difficult to make start to that direction I dont have money to go to private doctor and here where i live its already difficult to get to mental health care and even other health care nowdays is more like treating affect and the cause Support for someone thinking would need diagnosis,autism
1319,I'm not autistic myself but my girlfriend is We haven't been dating very long but it still affects our relationship and i'd like to better understand some of her reactions so i can get better So we're both seventeen and since I knew she was autistic before we started dating we agreed on what was acceptable and what wasn't like never touching her without asking even if it's just to touch her arm or hand until she's completely comfortable with me Anyway obviously i've accepted the conditions and i respect them so as not to make her feel uncomfortable But there are some strange things in her behavior for example when i talk to her by text she sometimes leaves me in seen without really explaining Or from time to time she stops talking for no apparent reason Some days she's really affectionate and the next day nothing I'm not complaining i just really want to understand so i can adapt myself the best i can and stop being frustrated when she left me on seen I know the best solution would probably be to talk to her about it but i'm rather shy and awkward when it comes to that kind of conversation I need to understand,autism
1320,Ahh it feels so good to be relieved of this burden of this toxicity No longer do I have to deal with the burden of her ignorant ableist comments her gaslighting and manipulation she called me entitled all the time so I played primadonna obviously She s gone forever If you want a story about it let me know I dumped her,autism

1328,1 socially inept much more than allistic people i know as well as some autistic people i know 2 i really like tone indicators because it's really difficult to know when somebody is joking or sarcastic even if it's obvious 3 i'm really unsure how the words i say or type come across so i constantly feel the need to overclarify because of anxiety and it ends up being very awkward 4 on a similar note i constantly misunderstand peoples intention when they say things and feel like they're mad at me when they aren't 5 i really don't know how to talk to people UNLESS it's something i'm very knowledgable on or is a fixation 6 when someone tries to tell me something and the details confuse me i tend to focus much more on that rather than their overall point at times completely missing what they are saying 7 i have a lot of hyperfixations quotes because not fully sure if they are where i can be completely obsessed with a game or a topic for hours a day at a time and then at a random point just completely drop it and lose all interest when i find something else sometimes i come back to them at a later time 8 eye contact never quite came naturally to me and i don't get the point of it people listen using their ears not their eyes and tend to just look at things around the person i CAN do eye contact if i have to but it isn't ideal 9 i stim a lot in the form of rocking back and forth and other times by clicking chattering my teeth usually to the beat of a song that's playing in my head but i don't flap my hands back and forth and find doing that quite uncomfortable on my wrists 10 i have huge attention to detail on things im hyperfixed on that other people won't notice nor care about and completely oblivious to the most basic things on stuff i am not interested in i think this is somewhat affected by my diagnosed ADHD 11 echolalia sometimes i like meowing especially if im in discord vcs and dont know what to say it's fun sometimes i like repeating phrases from youtube videos such as npesta's what no dude or ishowspeeds chat is this real 12 inability to just stop or give it up when having a conversation or issue with someone that i feel is not fully resolved or that i do not fully understand sometimes i write full paragraphs about it while the other person moved on in an attempt to get closure 13 i hate the feeling of showering being wet etc but ironically i love being in the rain 14 i constantly feel like i have the maturity of a 15 year old despite being 20 i always feel like im not adult enough compared to others if anyone has something like this please let me know which ones you relate to i numbered the list so you can just say which number i am diagnosed with adhd but im still on the fence of whether i show enough signs to seek out autism testing due to how expensive it is i am NOT looking for the comments to diagnose me i just want to know if any of these things are relatable to other people who DO have autism if you're allistic and relate to these things also let me know please same with adhd thank you very much for reading this post i a list of quirks and i want to know if people here with autism relate to them and by how much,autism

1339,So my ex psychiatrist before she left the practice I see to go work for another diagnosed me with BPD and bipolar 2 both of which are supported by my family history and I told her that I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD in childhood but I didn't have contact with that practitioner to back it up but that both run in my family She told me she didn't feel comfortable with putting those on my file until I get a professional diagnosis which is completely fair it's all for the paperwork I guess but then she tells me that she's unqualified to diagnose me and so is everyone at the practice I go to and that I'll need to see a specialist This is also fine but I then saw that in my state if you're diagnosed with autism you can't adopt and that's basically my only way to have kids as a gay guy so I didn't want that But I decided to pursue my ADHD diagnosis anyway That came back pretty fruitful but also ended up not being an official diagnosis because apparently this wasn't an official ADHD test just an impulsivity test Obviously I got mad at that point it's pretty frustrating because with none of this officially on my file I can't get proper treatment she tells me she'll leave ADHD and autism with question marks on my file This was pleasing enough for me however when I switched to a new psychiatrist as my old psychiatrist left the practice I was informed that because of my BPD and bipolar 2 diagnoses she deemed it unlikely that I could also have autism and ADHD despite leading me through all those flaming hoops and giving me hope about getting proper treatment My new psychiatrist then completely disregarded my concerns about that and pushed me towards mood stablizers which my doctors and I have discovered can actually kill me due to my current preexisting health conditions I tried to discuss this too but she won't listen to me until I'm on the medication for at least a month I haven't been taking the medication under the instruction of my primary care physician and I have a meeting with my psychiatrist coming up later this month I'm kinda terrified to see how things go once she realizes I'm unmedicated and questioning her capability to treat and diagnose me Half of my family doesn't want me on meds because they either listened to me or have their own biases and the others want me on the medication either because they blindly support my psychiatrist or because they refuse to listen to me Even my therapist supports my psychiatrist pushing me towards the medication with little Oh what's the worst that could happen You don't know until you try and Do you think all these fears about the medication are just your anxiety surrounding bad experiences with previous medications No actually It's that my doctors have told me that if I take this medication I will go into a coma and you the people who are supposed to care about me and keep me safe don't seem to be doing a very good job of either of these tasks My psychiatrist is unqualified,autism
1340,I 21F hate being neurodivergent and I wish I was neurotypical I would do anything to be neurotypical Yes it would completely erase who I am but if that erasure leaves behind lots of benefit for myself and people that know me it is for the better There is much more benefit to being NT They're advantaged they handle things better and they have better social lives If I were neurotypical I would be happy I wouldn't be too sensitive too awkward too weird annoying etc I would handle my emotions better I would actually have friends I would be accepted by people around me I would be 100 independent and never need help with anything at all at least anything that isn't socially acceptable I do everything in my power to be accepted by other people including masking every single one of my undesirable traits For example I don't speak unless spoken to I make sure not to say or do anything unnecessary and I always make sure to never get in people's way Yet I am still not accepted and off putting I make sure to also never stim never show my emotions and never talk about my interests All it does is bother people It bothers me too because I just want friends but I accepted that I will never have any if I am autistic especially showing my horrific traits that causes people to hate me At least 85 of the trauma that happened to me would have never occurred if I was neurotypical I will find a way to make myself normal I have to It is the only way I can be loved and accepted Being autistic only gets me abused and or ostracized so it is only safer for me if I become NT It is better for both myself and the people around me I basically dropped out of college and I am now a shut in because I believe it is my duty to protect others and keep them safe from myself as I don't want to subject other people to the horrors of dealing with someone like me My existence is a burden to both myself and others The only thing I want in life is to be neurotypical EDIT Finding ND friends is not an option either I don't get along with other ND people no matter how hard I try I had bad experiences with the other autistic people I have met I want to be cured of my autism,autism

1344,I live in the United States and it seems impossible to get low-gain hearing aids without waiting years When I was 15 I got diagnosed with an auditory processing disorder and neurodevelopmental disorder after years and years of pushing for help in school My teachers always would tell my parents that I was a smart girl but would do much better if I had more time They also said that I really lacked social stuff and doctors didn't want to take on more work so they would dismiss me I also found out that I was autistic shortly before the APD diagnosis I got the diagnosis at Dayton Children's in Ohio Now I'm 19 need some help and ideas on how to speed up the process of getting low-gain hearing aids I understand that these hearing aids are very new technology and even controversial though want to see if there is a way that I don't have to be on a waiting list for two years The journey started out with me finding out about the type of hearing aids I've always been told that since my hearing is fine hearing aids would not help which was true Now there are low-gain ones that would definitely help but less than 1 of audiologists know how to program them right So I went to my general doctor to get a recommendation from a different professional who would be able to help me with the hearing aids Instead she had me go to neurology Though I'm legally an adult Dayton Children's still tried to take me in again When we got there we repeatedly explained to the med student and the doctor why they were there They were both very nice listened and understood but didn't understand why I was sent to them because there was nothing they could do to help me They also didn't know anything about the hearing aids so they told us to make appointments with both ear nose and throat and audiology at Dayton Children's After the appointment I made an appointment with ENT and then called audiology who said they would refer me to the University of Ohio State in Columbus This is because Dayton Children's didn't have any doctors who knew much about low-gain hearing aids but knew that Ohio State might have someone who specialized in that area since the technology is new Since then I've been on a waiting list since August of 2023 I didn't expect it to be a quick process but I'm trying to see if there is any way to speed it up It seems like no one knows about low gain hearing aids Since then I've been on a waiting list since August of 2023 I didn't expect it to be a quick process but I'm trying to see if there is any way to speed it up It seems like no one knows about low-gain hearing aids nd some of the receptionists even talked to me like I was stupid After telling them I have no hearing loss they would have a long pause like I was pulling a prank on them or something An audiologist in Greenville Ohio recommended calling Ball State In Indiana and Bloomington University of Indiana I called both and neither knew about them but Gave me the phone number and name to a different audiologist that might This audiologist specializes in auditory processing disorder When I called her the assistant gave me more information which was extremely helpful Gave me the fax number and said that if I gave documentation of my diagnosis we could schedule an appointment I'm getting my hopes up that after I send the document I will get the process rolling but I have no idea if my insurance will cover out of state I've seen so-called low-gain hearing aids on the Jabra website that are below 1k but why would I have to pay for them when I can't even get an appointment in my state Does anyone know about this side of insurance When I called the University of Michigan which has been raised with their medical system they acted like I was crazy and absolutely stupid The assistant told me that I could start on the waiting list but most likely wouldn't be able to get in for a hearing test at least until July This was after I already told her that I have no hearing loss and I don't need a hearing test-just have a processing disorder She had no idea what to say so she asked the doctor Then came back to me saying With those hearing aids you can just buy over the counter I know that I can just go to Walmart and buy a pair of hearing aids but I know nothing about them or if it requires a specific hearing aids This is not to mention that I have no idea how to program them and even if I deep searched I would not be able to learn how to The internet has no articles videos books There is just about nothing telling on how to program low gain hearing aids I feel confused with this journey Do I have to get an appointment in Ohio for my insurance to pay for the appoint s and the heating aids If so where who do I goto in Ohio What about if it does not have to be in Ohio Who where How long did you have to wait to get an appointment Why do the audiologists act like I'm stupid and crazy lol Need Help Getting Low Gain Hearing Aids,autism

1346,Hi y'all amp x200B First post here and I'm rally excited I don't really have a network of other perople in the spectrum near me So I know not everyone in the spectrum deals with alexithymia but I notice I have a particularly hard time with it I tend to make things about me or what I think I should do instead of maybe asking what others need or taking them into account Do any of you have any coping strategies for that amp x200B Also I think I might be a covert narcissist I feel like I check a lot of the boxes However my therapist says that's probably not the case since people in the spectrum are often misdiagnosed as narcissistic Do any of you have similar experiences with that amp x200B Hope I get to talk to some of you have a good one Alexithymia and Covert Narcissism,autism

1348,Hello sorry in advance if this is a long post I am a 20M who is neurotypical and am talking to a 20F who is neurodiverse We met in classes about a little over a year ago and from my perspective she was the one who first initiated conversation I have social anxiety so it was a pleasant surprise that someone else was interested in talking to me as people usually think I'm too intimidating to approach or something and I tend to stick to myself Eventually we got more comfortable talking to each other and started doing stuff outside of class During this time she seemed very engaged in texting but would occasionally just disappear without any responsee for like a week I got way too into my head and assumed that her hot cold behavior was her way of expressing frustration that I wasn't pursuing her but I realize now it's a common trait of autism I asked her on a date and she basically said that she has too much going on in life but still really likes me She also said that she becomes avoidant if she feels forced to make time I told her I understood and if it's easier I would like to just stay as friends because I value our connection She assured me that the pressure didn't come from me but I still worry that I will scare her away by making her feel pressured After that we were hanging out again and while sitting together she positioned herself so we were up against each other and basically cuddling After that we watched a movie and she wanted me to put her arm around so I did Now I'm confused because she isn't receptive to hugs so I've assumed that physical contact is a no-go but maybe I'm wrong I also don't know how to take it personally when she goes silent for weeks at a time When we are in person and texting it's clear that she enjoys my company but then all of a sudden she will just drop off the planet She usually texts me appologetically a few weeks later and the cycle continues again I try not to text her at all during this period in case I'm adding to her stress but I also worry that she takes that as me be frustrated or not interested I've also avoided bringing up the topic of her autism since she seems kind of embarrassed when it comes up and gets silent I'd like to have a conversation about what's going on from her perspective but I feel like that would put too much pressure on our interactions If anyone could explain patterns of autism that could be affecting this situation it would be greatly appreciated as I just don't know enough and am completely stumped I know that everyone is an individual person as well and this could just be how she expresses herself autism or not Advice on NT ND Situationship,autism
1349,I am in deep emotional pain and I am ready to just give up Having Aspergers has made my life absolute living hell At 29 I am still living at home with my abusive mother and pushover of a father because I cant afford an apartment or even a room My dating life is pathetic and apart from a one night stand which I was too drunk to remember i am a virgin to despite longing to have a wife and children maybe in hopes of trying to build some sort of love in family into my life As for friends they are limited and predominantly out of province My sister hates me for trying to step in while my parents had their heads up their asses raising us neither of my parents should be allowed to raise a dog let alone a child As for the rest of my family they either don't understand or don't care many of whom turned a blind eye to my mother's abuse I have struggled to keep a job as my analytical mind always turns to wanting to solve the problems of company and make things work for everyone which is something that few companies have any sort of appreciation for My college diploma has also proven to be about as useful as toilet paper and sincerely regret having spent nearly 30k to be taught by woefully incompetent professors at an absolute joke of a college I do have a business but it is struggling massively and even in the best case scenario would never be able to be my primary source of income I have also struggled with my weight and appearance often trying numb the pain with food Lately I have little to no happiness in my life and struggle to stay awake or even get out of bed I also suffer from PTSD as a result of my mothers abuse as well as from Cadets where I saw and experienced many things I can't even bring myself to talk about I also feel deep pain from no longer being able to work summer camps as it truly is the only time I have had anything resembling love or family in my life As for reaching out for help I have seen numerous doctors pastors and counsellors along with having been on a wide array of antidepressants all to no avail I feel betrayed by god and I really don't know where to turn to try and find some happiness or sense of belonging in this life Nor do a have any idea how to cope with the immense pain I am in Where to turn,autism

1356,Hi everyone I've recently moved into a new city and had to leave basically all of my stuff behind I'm trying to use this as an opportunity to make my space more autism-friendly rather than very utilitarian and easy to pack up and go I've got all of my special interest fibre arts stuff in one corner all of my dog stuff in one corner and I'm moving on to my bed I was googling around options because I've got a vague idea of what I want Old box bed type setups look really really cool I've loved super tight enclosed spaces my whole life the smaller the better Until I was like 16 I had a big chest that I had a nest in and I could barely fit and I only gave it up because I moved away from my parents Im looking at making a bed ceiling like shelves on the side and a closed in top and only a little bit of space in between myself and the roof like just enough that I could sit up and my dogs BBM and black lab can stand up comfortably Has anyone done anything similar Are there any words I can look up to find examples Bed organisation,autism
1357,So I was extremely badly bullied as a kid and I learned that attempts to be sociable would lead to me being abused by others It was always made clear that any attempts from me to interact would be an imposition so I never learned to either invite anyone to anything And this was reinforced throughout childhood But since I started work people have expressed that I am standoffish and I remember one person in particular was very insistent that I didn't include myself and that it was my responsibility to include myself and this person reminded me so much of the same people who had bashed me for trying to interact as a child I have liked the few times anyone has called me but I feel like if I call anyone back or if I initiate contact that people will see that as me being a horrible person or me being a stalker And the thing is that I have always wanted to include myself and to interact with others and I keep feeling this horrible feeling like I can't breathe when I see other people successfully interacting or when people imply something like I should be doing this and don't know why I don't I was just wondering about some example messages of things that people might say to reach out to others or to start social interactions And if you're looking for clarification the biggest thing to note is that I have such little experience that I wouldn't even know what kind of things I'd be clarifying between Can someone please explain what are justifiable reasons you can reach out to others And like a example message or something you might say,autism
1358,This has always been my biggest fight with my parents but especially my mother She gets really frustrated with me all the time and gets into huge fights with my dad over how she thinks he failed at raising me I used to internalize it a lot but since realizing I m probably autistic it s put so many things into perspective My mom doesn t understand my needs Whenever she sees me struggling with something she assumes it s either because I m lazy or I just can t do it For example with cleaning it s often difficult for me to make myself do it I need time to mentally adjust to whatever living space I m in first then I have to mentally prepare myself for what I want to do and I have to get it all organized in a system that I designed for myself But it s very difficult for me to clean when I m in an unfamiliar space working with someone else s things rules etc and I get easily overwhelmed On the outside it just looks like I don t want to do the thing but inside I m feeling stressed overwhelmed and self-hating There are so many things I didn t realize I was actually capable of until I went to college and could figure things out on my own but whenever I come home the cycle begins again and she starts to doubt that I m even capable of being an adult My family are convinced I m lazy and can t do anything for myself even though it s not true,autism

1361,Preface this by saying I don't believe I have autism but am neurodivergent and seek sensory materials to self-soothe I am an ally within the field I believe many of the signs of autism also apply to other divergencies I have a cat who cuddles up to me each night in a position like I'm a kid holding a teddy bear I have a hard time sleeping away from her but when I stay in places local I bring one of many soft worn-in blankets to run between my fingers when anxious and or before bed I am going on a plane for the first time in a while for a trip next week which gives me a lot of anxiety A blanket is too big to bring with me Any suggestions on touch-friendly materials or items to buy amp x200B amp x200B Favorite Material to touch as a sensory device,autism
1362,Hi there I'm an autistic person who studies things as a hobby I've started to notice more and more a thing that happens when I meet other like-minded autistic people Sometimes it happens later on or right on first conversation but I feel this sort of CLICK when I feel like I connect with another person I know the idea of clicking with people just exists as a whole but this feels different It sort of feels like a psychic bond in a way Like a sort of I've known you my whole life even though that's objectively not true This may be unrelated to autism and instead just some other weird thing I feel but I wanted to come here and ask since I only really experience this with other autistic people Looking to find more info on a phenomenon,autism
1363,My brother was watching X-Men The Last Stand and it was pretty rough for me I'm pretty sure he just saw it as a cool superhero movie but I did not It hit too close to home All the talk about the X mutation being a disease and there being a new cure for it made me uncomfortable to the point where it was hard to eat my dinner I ended up leaving and going to my room as soon as I could Afterwards I tried to talk about it with my parents but they only seemed to notice the gratuitous violence and language that they didn't like I wasn't around for those parts of the movie I was the only one who picked up on the metaphor it seemed I felt like I sounded all pretentious trying to discuss it like one of those fake deep Instagram teens I just want to know if this movie made anyone else uncomfortable the same way it did for me Thoughts on X-Men The Last Stand,autism
1364,not the most descriptive title but found it difficult to phrase what i mean i notice it mostly in video games i always do the exact same thing whenever i replay a game in stardew valley i always give my farmer and their farm the same name i always have the same appearance in rdr2 my favourite game that i ve replayed many times i always dress Arthur exactly the same same hair too i got emotionally attached to the black horse given to him early game and kept him til the end which i have done in every single subsequent play through because it doesn t feel right to have a different horse in cyberpunk after about 60 hours of my first character i made a new one with a different appearance background skills but i didn t like it and restarted to replicate my original character in skyrim i spent years playing the same race and build until somebody showed me a new one and for once it stuck with me but you get the idea i explained this to my NT boyfriend who thought it was unusual so thought i would ask here to see if any autistic peeps can relate does anyone else find it hard to break repetition when it comes to things like creating multiple characters for the same game,autism

1369,I am often unable to speak more a few words when I m at my sensory limit I m certain that people can t understand what is happening All I want in those situations is reduced sensory input but communicating that point feels impossible due to inability to speak and formulate my thoughts One of the big things I ve learned during a very stressful time these last few years is that most people don t understand sensory overload and making a request of any kind to reduce sensory input usually results in increased sensory input My trauma response has been severe lately and I ve isolated myself partly because people seem clueless about any request I ve made about limiting sensory input I m beginning to get in contact with people again A family friend is helping me but I m really struggling to get him to understand my sensory limits He s a neurotypical extrovert and honestly a really nice guy But I don t think he understands my sensory overload Conversations are difficult and my silence is probably interpreted as me listening rather than me being overloaded During past interactions he denied my requests for much needed breaks from sensory input so now I think he probably doesn t understand enough about my sensory processing to respond in a way that helps Just wondering if anyone has found a solution that works for communicating sensory overload to people who don t have the experience of sensory overload Trying to figure out how to communicate effectively when I can t speak due to sensory overload,autism
1370,I 26M was only diagnosed a few months ago and before that having autism was never even a thought that crossed my mind This is probably gonna be kind of long Rant 1 All of the issues that I have faced dealing with autism in my life half pretty much all been internal ones besides the social issues which was just put down to me being shy awkward But even so I am still realizing I have a lot of resentment towards my parents mom especially for not noticing these signs and possibly getting some kind of diagnosis much earlier to maybe get some accommodations and more support She is an educational assistant and has worked with ND kids in school for decades including many with autism so why did she pick up on any of my signs or problems I know it's not right for me to be so mad at her for this but it's still really tough Anyone else have a similar situation like this Rant 2 I've realized I also have a lot of resentment towards my parents about my sensory needs not being taken seriously For years and years before getting diagnosed I had always complained about my issues with the temperature of our place as well as certain sounds bothering me This was before I even knew about sensory issues that autistic people face The complaints were always met with well we get way too cold when you turn the heat down or we can't control the noises we make when we breath or eat My needs are now only started to be considered after I've been medically diagnosed with a disability It pisses me off that just because I couldn't articulate just how much the issues were bothering me that they weren't taken seriously even though I constantly complained about them That's all thanks for taking the time to read this Just need somewhere to rant get some resentment off my chest,autism
1371,Hello all self-diagnosed 22 f here Recently I have been going through the process of unmasking I have loved bathing instead of showering for as long as I can remember This evening while bathing I was taking some deep breaths while my ears were submerged under the water and it was so soothing The sound of my breathing muffled the sound of my heartbeat and being underwater blocked out ambient noise I remembered how as a child I would lay on my belly in the bath take a deep breath in put my mouth under the water and slowly breathe out making a steady stream of bubbles I did this for several minutes tonight and it brought me so much peace I felt recentered as if I'd been given a temporary reprise from the sensory overload I have become so accustomed to The thought crossed my mind What will my family members think if they hear me blowing bubbles in the bath as a fully grown woman I realized that I'd forgotten about these kinds of self-regulating behaviors out of shame and fear of being ridiculed I was almost brought to tears Finally I've remembered something positive I used to do to regulate myself after years of skin picking substance abuse and other maladaptive strategies to give me some sort of release or perhaps to fill the void I am happy and sad at the same time happy I got to recover this and sad because I'd forced myself to behave like a normal person for so long Writing this has brought me to tears If anyone reads this and has a similar story I'd love to read it I've felt so crazy through this whole process of discovering that I'm neurodivergent over the past few years and the only thing that has made me feel less alone is all of you lovely people on this website I'm safe here none of you know me so your opinion of me can't change I don't know if I'll ever be able to discuss this sort of thing openly with my family and I think that's okay I'm just grateful to finally feel like I belong somewhere lt 3 TLDR Rediscovered some healthy stims from my childhood and it brought about a lot of emotions Learning how to incorporate them into my adult life Unmasking and rediscovering childhood stims,autism

1380,Hello everyone Long term lurker here and this sub has been immensely helpful in helping family and learning about autism in general So onto my reason for posting here I am thinking of creating a platform for people with neurodivergent issues to interact with each other This would initially be akin to a group therapy program wherein people with similar conditions can talk to each other about their experiences as a neurodivergent person in a safe space with moderators guiding the discussion At first it would be primarily a way for people with similar conditions to interact digitally in a safe environment allowing others to feel less alone The conversation would be moderated to reduce trauma-dumping and the burden other members feel over others problems primarily to limit the act of people feeling responsible over each other and to limit suicidal conversation in people without proper training There would be no private interaction between different people and giving off-platform communication channels would be barred This platform would allow people with similar conditions to share their experiences in life thereby helping each other feel less isolated and hopefully help people to create positive habits by learning from others with similar conditions as them Additionally I think it would be helpful to have specific chats where people can discuss finding a job creating a business or other real-world applications and tips that they have used with their neurodivergent condition to be able to succeed and thrive Think networking and tips from other individuals like themselves In the future incorporating private therapy specifically for people with these issues would be ideal Some basic background behind this idea is that my brother has autism and ADHD He s been seeing a therapist for years because our family has the resources to provide that but it hasn t really solved any of his underlying issues and he tends to resort back to a cycle of self-deprecation until he becomes severely depressed Recently he had a severe bout of depression mainly caused by his ADHD and autism and his school which resulted in him being checked into a psychiatric hospital twice in the course of 3 months I d visit him every day and we would talk about the issues he faced and whether any of the treatment seemed to be helping him Towards the end of his second bout at the hospital he started saying that group therapy seemed to help a bit hearing that others had similar ailments to him and were able to live their lives getting tips from people who have actually been through similar situations and experienced similar feelings to him This seemed to help him more than any other therapy While group therapy helped him a bit it may not help everyone and he and I are aware of that Yet just being able to view the conversations of people and understand his problems are not isolated to just him is a big thing We were hoping to bring this into the real world and sort of narrow our focus down based on what is most useful to people with neurodivergent conditions that inhibit their daily lives Any feedback is helpful and please let me know if you would use this type of program if so which parts Feedback for platform to help people with autism and neurodivergent conditions,autism

1397,Hi everyone I ve recently found out that I use sex as a dopamine hit Or like the craving of it because I m too anxious to actually get some But it s become an actual problem somehow Whenever I get to know someone romantically or even platonically I start flirting and become hypersexual despite not even wanting to do that I just wanna be loved and respected but somehow it always turns sexual And then for for weeks nothing sexual at all and I basically ghost people It just comes and goes but I figured out I do this for the dopamine Does anyone know how to regulate yourself or have tips to deal with it I think things would be easier if I had a partner and just get it out of my system but it always kinda destroys the getting-to-know a person moments especially when I lose interest right away I ve always felt like I m sabotaging myself and potential relationships with it But I think I m just hella disregulated Dopamine hits with nsfw things,autism

1414,Some of the diagnostic criteria has to do with sensory issues I am emotionally sensitive and can be sensitive to crowds IF there is a constant emotional demand on my attention but otherwise I am not bothered by crowds I just ignore them I can hear electricity and traffic but it doesn't bother me I can work in coffee shops Heck I can take naps in coffee shops I am not bothered by loud sounds with the exception of fire alarms both chirping and actual alarm or if someone honking a horn at me but some of that is emotional I listen to music with the sound higher than advised I also don't seem to feel pain to the same degree as other people I can drink near boiling water I get bruises and scratches and shake them off in seconds As a child if I fell down I would get right back up I am not bothered by smells My mother would say she had a sensitive nose and I could almost never smell what she did I like candles and bath bombs I am not bothered by perfumes If I dislike a particular scent it bothers me e g glade plugins or scented cat litter smells awful to me but I don't think that is atypical Sometimes I like pungent scents other people do not I don't have a strong aversion to tastes or texture of food either with the exception of coconut and pulp or tapioca but this is a small list of unpleasant foods I like really flavorful foods like sauces I can struggle with quickly changing temperatures but not to an extreme degree I can take walks in cold weather if I am appropriately attired I hate heat but who doesn't I live in a temperate area though I have not noticed bright lights bother me If anything low lights can be too dim if I am expected to work in a space without adequate light I do wear sunglasses when it is sunny but I don't need them I rip tags off my clothes and I prefer comfortable clothes esp if I am going to be sitting or lounging but I can wear uncomfortable clothes if I need to as long as they are not itchy or ill-fitting But even uncomfortable clothes doesn't cause meltdowns I like the way some fabrics feel I have a way of dissassociating that may be relevant here I retreat deep inside my head and maybe that is why I am not bothered If I need to be on emotionally I do get exhausted quickly and the more sensations there are the faster that can happen but if I am alone I just disappear inside my brain and all the senses kind of mute Does anyone else have an experience like this Any other hyposensitives,autism

1416,So I open up Reddit and see a lot of selfies on this sub I notice it's a trend and move on One day later I open up Reddit again and see text posts arguing about the image post blocade First of all selfies are neither the best thing to do nor a direct ban and I think many people agree but they might be too revealing and dangerous This trend changes the points of vue Some people are just ok with it and might follow along some people including me find it stupid and won't care some will care like the mods apparently and in answer to that some will try to fight for freedom of expression All those opinions are ok and make up a healthy community and I will get both likes and dislikes The mods have all the right in the world to estimate the danger of this trend great enough for temporary text-only posts as they are supposed to have experience with moderating as well as autism Thank you for your time consider correcting happy new year A hopefully opinion-devoid thought on the selfie discussion,autism

1425,I 25F been in a healthy seemingly wholesome relationship with a guy 25M I met via tinder since August we met in July and he s been such an amazing person and gives me hope that not all men are bad or abusive like my first boyfriend and situationships I m actually his first girlfriend and basically first everything but sometimes it feels like he s experienced based how well he treats me and deeply cares for my feelings and well being I did drop hints such as knowing I get overwhelmed by being around people for a long period of time receiving ssi benefits and how I need personal space often All I told him that I m neurodivergent and suffer from anxiety and depression I feel like I have to tell him eventually as he s already introduced me to his family and friends and they all seem to like me Not to mention already plans out our future together I feel like I m an awful person for not being upfront with him about my condition as I dealt with intense ableism growing up in the 2000s and was told all my life that I ll never be able to keep a man and shouldn t have any children due to being autistic I could pass as neurotypical and most people would be surprised but my diagnosis of autism and emotional disturbance is considered overexaggerated and I never exhibited signs of the latter especially after elementary school My abusive older sister that never gets called out by my family hopes that my boyfriend will leave me after he finds out the truth and even recording me during an firey argument so she can post it somewhere to humiliate me my family members have done this before more than once but thankfully never posted anything My boyfriend is aware of her lifelong abuse towards me but I still have that extreme fear of abandonment because of her and my family unwilling to see how much I grew up and blossomed Even though I out earned most of them and live on my own I feel like it s never enough for them especially my older sister who s in an unhealthy codependent relationship with her boyfriend for the past 7-8 years which sometimes lean towards abusive on her end What can I do Hiding my autism from my partner make me feel so selfish,autism

1431,I 19afab am not autistic but have adhd my partner 18amab has undiagnosed autism they went in for a diagnosis and came out with RSD diagnosis but still believe they have autism I've know them for nearly 4 years now and i believe it uk the signs are all there they're just high functioning idk if that term is still relevant high masking is more like it I moved in with them a year ago and we've been okay for the most part but since moving in it's been different They don't want to do anything w me anymore bc now that we live together they're very well we have tmrw then tmrw comes then the next day then the next I make accommodations when we go out i only go to places they wanna go to and we go home as soon as they want to but they still seem miserable the entire time so now we don't go out anymore So now we just talk sit around and talk but their new thing is arguing about nothing Most recent example they brought up that their dad bought a stool for the kitchen me and their sister are 5ft tall so i said oh yeah ik he brought it out new years night he was drunk and was trying not to fall off it while getting cups down Their response was to say he wasn't that drunk he wouldn't have been falling off it He was he was hanging onto it for dear life and knocking stuff in the cabinet over and ik that bc i was there i saw it with my own two eyes but somehow i was wrong They sit at their desk 24 7 watching debate videos and i genuinely think it's what's effecting them they didn't argue like they do now until they starting watching this stuff all the time It probably shouldn't bug me as much as it does but it does i'm sensitive to correction after living in a household that does nothing but argue all day Please let me know if i'm the one at fault here or dm for further questions partner with autism,autism

1434,Hello all I am an auDHD double diagnosed with ADHD and autism level 1 and my autism traits are mostly concentrated in the social cues body language voice expressions etc So I am talkative I like communicating being social going to events yet still having difficulties expressing it properly and people tend to read me as the opposite As a person who does not enjoy public settings and I have to explain every time this is not the case Does it happen to any of you Does anyone have any coping strategies For fellow autistics yet still People persons do you ever experience misunderstanding from NT,autism
1435,I like talking to myself I dont like repeating myself especially when being asked to repeat something that was only meant for myself If i wanted other people to hear me i would speak clearly and directly to them Every guy ive explained this to is like oh fosho And never ask me to repeat myself again Trying to explain this to a woman however they assume im insulting them under my breath or im just shy and they INSIST that i need to repeat myself every fucking time If i dont they get offended like im breaking one of those unwritten social rules So i usually just fold repeat myself and then deal with their dismissive small talk that i accidentally initiated Recently i explained to a coworker because it was happening every other day and she was never actually interested in what i was saying so i thought id just tell her you dont have to keep asking me to repeat myself Well now i dont deserve to talk to her ever She ignores every word i say even though its all work related and she informed all our other co-workers that im an asshole and a weirdo whose not worth speaking to The only reason i talk to myself is for the sense of comfort it brings me Whether im feeling anxious or just need to express a short bout of excitement it really helps But now its alienated me within my workplace Edit It just dawned on me that if i were a woman most guys would probably harass me on a totally different degree if i tried telling them not to worry about what im saying to myself But thats more a matter of being cringe not a matter of social acceptance Does anyone else find that men are more accepting of their unmasked traits,autism

1494,Hi everyone The other day I shared that I really enjoyed collecting all kinds of stuff Sorting through things helps me a lot with stress My collections are pretty random though as my interests change frequently I was wondering what kinds of things do you guys like to collect Are there any objects you have that you just really enjoy looking at Do you enjoy sharing and talking about your stuff with others like me or are you very private about your stuff Not really important questions but I guess I'm just curious and interested in asking What do you guys enjoy collecting,autism
1495,I prefer it because I ve had issues in the past with accepting the diagnosis It made me feel horrible at first my mum handed me the paper from the doctor with an unhappy and pale face I felt like she had just seen me be murdered with how she reacted I read it and looked up at her and all she had to say was what do I do after snatching the paper back and handing it to my dad I genuinely felt disgusted in myself all the people at school made autistic jokes and I just had so much hate towards the diagnosis My school didn t like it and tried to put me straight into a special needs unit when I function well independently By saying person with autism it helps me feel more like a person with an identity that isn t just the struggles that come with autism I can acknowledge that I think differently and I am different but I m just a regular person that has some struggles that are different than maybe an allistic person Other autistic people don t like it and say I push the image that autism is a disease and should be shunned Even though I always make sure to be confident in my diagnosis when telling others and specifically when telling people about autism and how different it is for others I address the stigma of autism and how others prefer to be addressed differently when behaving autism introduced with who they are I just feel like it shouldn t bother other people as much as it does and that s what bothers me I prefer person with autism over autistic person and I feel like it s pushing some people away,autism
1496,Although the selfie trend is a bit odd random imo I quite enjoyed it since it showed various things from self confidence acceptance to that ASD doesn't have a look It also adds a sense of community which I haven't had elsewhere Everyone has their opinion on it but I found it oddly heart warming I understand those of us who disagree though I looked through the other site that is attacking the selfies the community and what they're saying and honestly it reinforces what I think that I mentioned above instead of the opposite Those folks are insecure and either dont know what they're saying or have some serious issues deep down Of course I'm generalizing but that's usually how it goes I understand what it is like to be targeted and feel for anyone who was since I've noticed trolls like to target people who are comfortable or have something they dont whether that is community comfortability acceptance or whatever so if anything the community should feel stronger and more united My thoughts on the trolls,autism

1500,It's a tale as old as time If your post here is successful you get the slimiest creatures crawling from god knows where with words that drip with malice and cruelty They know your insecurities and care only about getting a reaction from you This is supposed to be our community our escape from people who think we exist solely for their entertainment their mocking words their cruel tricks and that community has been stolen from us Sure I could grow a harder shell I did that long ago and it's finally cracking I'm tired of hiding and I don't want to hide who I am just because some troglodyte feels like telling strangers that they shouldn't exist 2024 will be the year that we can finally be ourselves without fearing or even caring what other people think I no longer feel safe in r autism but together we can change that for everyone who feels the same way Does anyone else just not feel safe in this sub anymore,autism
1501,When I was on winter break I hardly thought about my favorite game but it was the first thing I thought about when I woke up this morning I was thinking heavily about the DLC of my favorite game and a certain character in it so I got distracted getting ready and my mom pointed out I wasn t paying attention to her and then proceeded to trigger me my OCD anxiety on the car ride That DLC It was literally the only thing keeping me alive back then I was counting down the days and I was glued to my TV until I beat it the day it came out And of course I daydreamed the hell out of it and thought of so many theories It was amazing but the spark has been gone For almost 3 months now Now the devs are working on multiplayer I personally just want the devs to start another DLC that I can obsess over already I m so hypervigilant at school and I m scared of everyone here I m so scared they re gonna trigger my OCD and send me into a full blown meltdown My mom almost did I wish I could live in the world that my favorite game takes place in so I never have to worry about my OCD being triggered in any way Fall asleep on earth and wake up on the beach of the world of my favorite game like my OC that s all I want No more triggering topics Just having fun with my friends and partner that are already in my imagination battle explore People tell me I have an obsession with this game They see stuff like this and tell me I have problems I ve been called a bootlicker for the devs of my favorite game and someone even said they need to increase their security this was in response to me vigorously defending the devs because someone replied under me knowing how I was about the game and the devs that it was unacceptable that they haven t fixed a game breaking bug on Xbox and they knew about it That sent me They called the devs bad people I had a meltdown in the comment section Not my proudest moment Several people told me the devs would be ashamed and disgusted with me They said I need normal ways to cope This game IS my coping mechanism And then people wonder why I get so upset by people criticizing the game but I m working on that They make me feel like I should never touch another game again with how I am with this one in particular I think so heavily about the game and its characters to cope because I m so scared about the world I find myself in I ship myself with the main villain to cope I listen to the OST to cope I buy plushies to cope It s all coping I m deathly afraid of someone taking all of this away from me That s why I m so scared of therapists I feel like they won t understand me This is just a mix of me talking about my maladaptive daydreaming and my hyperfixation Wasn t sure what I m doing with this I just need it out First day of school back Already using my hyperfixation to cope heavily,autism

1504,Hello I m new here and I wanted to ask a question What counts as a meltdown shutdown and or burnout And what is the possible name of what has been happening to me Foreword This is a long rant I am not diagnosed nor self-diagnosed 2 years ago I realized that I may actually be autistic I have since then done a lot of research in the matter and the only box I can t quite check is the meltdown shutdown and burnout one mostly because I don t understand what it actually means These things had happened all my life And I really hope someone here could help me clarify if this is thing s count as meltdown shutdown or if I should look into something else Development or my experience and if they count or not I mostly always hide almost always in the restroom I cry uncontrollably sometimes if I get like scared someone will see me I freeze and just pause and act as usual but sometimes I just can't stop and I can take a whole day to stop crying I can talk but can not explain myself if there is someone with me I would probably say I m fine I m fine and continue to cry without elaborating if I m alone I would probably whisper to myself or mentally talk to myself Before crying I would probably feel anxious like feeling something someone is behind me and like a white noise in my head or as if I were looking from far away and act in automatic I can feel the blood and heat rushing to my head especially my ears and my eyes I can hear my heart beating and feel like there is electricity travelling to my body in spasms In the midst I feel awful and cry a lot shake rock sometimes feel like my skin is burning and have obsessive thoughts Sometimes it happens that I feel all this but like save it for later meanwhile I act as usual but on the inside I'm consuming with anxiety The next days I may feel like my jaw is really tight my brain is soup or eat barely anything get headaches feel like I m floating falling asleep a lump in my throat uncomfortable heat or like I released a burden and feel quite happy It almost trigger by some thought emotion or information thing I saw or felt Especially if I feel out of control of my person or my future or by feeling like I m not good enough When it is caused by a sensation I just like drift away go into autopilot mode like completely devoid of anything while getting the work done or go into full teary-eyed people pleasing mode I talk more than usual smile a lot in a non me smile and act very helpful and people pleasing until I get exhausted and my body probably aches a lot at this point Just have horrible thoughts in general and feel like I m burning on the inside while keeping a almost always good facade Here are some examples of things I ve written before after and during that times to illustrate and try to understand my feeling ex 1 last year I don t want to lose control I have overworked myself with poison thoughts The fear comes by to freeze my flesh I don t even move I just wait For it to freeze me out ex 2 last month Blood blood only heat only blood only pain senseless pain futile pain tremendously unnecessary Pain every step tea a moan my eyes my ears my head burn burn there is nothing no expression only burning only fire only the ritual of blood ex 3 2 3 years ago Who Who would ever understand this This this all this fear this freedom of being no one I Not even I understand what do I do things how I m going to react I m going to explode Or I ll be a calm sea Why do I keep locking myself in my emotions all these things I have stuck ex 4 2 years ago I live this life loving so needy loving so passionately with all my pieces of self how is this possible I have learned to cry inside of me alone and quiet to smile when the walls are coming in to shut my anger off to eat it to turn off my feeling I try my best that is so less but I try but it seems that I can t be someone good I beat myself up with words and I do it with a smile in my face I live feeling like someone I m not living with an identity that does not belong to me Thank you for reading my really long rant list And I'm sorry if all this sounds so weird and or I'm oversharing this is the first time I talk about it and it used to freak me out so much that I just want to understand what is it lt 3 A few questions about meltdowns my experiences,autism

1508,gt Trigger warning Mention of suicide lt First 2 paragraphs are about my struggle with depression which I added because idk if it's relevant Skip ahead if not interested I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in Jan 2023 after I tried to end myself I won't go into details but I did end up purchasing a knife The thing is I've been struggling with what I perceived to be depression and anxiety since 2011 I thought I had depression because that's the first time I contemplated ending things by jumping and over the years I have continued to mentally explore various possibilities overdose drowning etc Around 2018 2019 I did end up writing a goodbye note and I had everything planned out but nothing came of it But it's only last year when I started therapy that I realised ending things was a means to an end for me I don't think I'm necessarily depressed just that I don't think there is a purpose to living if it makes sense As for my social anxiety I think it manifested in 2011 because I had developed this notion that extroverted kids were popular so I adopted this persona whereby I would talk to everyone I was always laughing and making a lot of noise in general I also really got into Kpop anime and pop think 1D and Taylor Swift because that's what everyone around me was interested in But despite knowing what everyone was interested in I realised I didn't know how to continue the conversation and it'll look something like Friend Did you listen to XX song by YY group Me Yeah I love it It's so good and catchy Friend Yeah haha Me Haha Overtime I just didn't know how to talk to people and it developed into extreme introversion and social anxiety I didn't think much about my depression and anxiety diagnosis until I saw an autistic tiktoker talking about how people with autism can get misdiagnosed with depression and anxiety and it got me thinking if this is me I'm not really sure if I exhibit traits of autism but some things about me I either make excessive eye contact or no eye contact at all I have high inertia in the sense that it takes all my energy to get started on a task but once I get started it's easy to keep on going though I do end up crashing when I'm done I'm like an iphone stuck on 20 battery even when my charging port is plugged in Any kind of social interaction wipes out my social battery and I recharge by being on my phone scrolling tiktok reading webnovels Someone once told me I text weird and that destroyed me We're talking about 2014 2015 when teens would type at the end of a sentence randomly sending a string of HAHAHA or BAHAHA using words like lol and totes you get the gist I would basically see how other would text and reply to them in the exact same way so if someone texted in all caps I would respond in all caps So when a close friend told me I text weirdly when all I was doing was copying how she texted I was shattered But I also don't think I'm autistic is because I don't get hyperfixated on anything The closest would be the time when I was hooked on Naruto and could recite the plot from front to back but it wasn't like I knew every single obscure character and every random fact And I'm pretty sure I don't have the autistic stare And I would say I'm very good at reading people as long as we end the conversation and you give me at least 1 night to reflect and analyse TLDR I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I think it might be a misdiagnosis and I could be autistic so I just need to know if I'm justified in my thinking and whether I'm delusional for wanting to suggest I'm autistic to my psychiatrist Need Validation I think I might be autistic or at least neurodivergent,autism
1509,So basically I used to be in love with mini chicken pot pies cheerios and milk and or pizza rolls as my main get home from work snacks before eating dinner my parents cooked For the record I do not eat breakfast ever because I do not like any breakfast foods However recently I have lost my appetite for all of those foods mentioned and I feel like I m starving I m basically going all day eating random tidbits of pantry stuff and only eating dinner as a meal I ve thought about going out to eat just to eat something big during the day but I feel like it s a waste of money and unhealthy I am currently fixated on pomegranates but I can t make a meal out of it lol Any advice anyone relate Anyone else just starve when they lose get tired of their safe foods,autism
1510,The thought occurred to me a few times while dating but I also just thought she might be reserved and shy The reason I think our relationship struggled was a lack of communication I have ADHD so am also neurodiverse but have a really strong need to talk share feelings etc She s the opposite almost to the point of being emotionally unavailable but in a way that felt natural not like an abuse tactic or result of trauma Then when I came to this reddit group I saw two girls who honestly look VERY similar in style glasses and even facial expressions she has a library girl-next-door vintage style Is this a coincidence or somehow popular with autistic girls Her possibly being autistic was never brought up in our relationship and didn t seem like something she d thought about but in all honesty she did seem to fit a lot of the characteristics just based on what I ve read I just wanted to make this post to talk to others about it maybe even get an opinion Although obviously that s hard since no one knows her I don t even know if it s the right sub to do that but I still think about her all the time I never really knew what she was thinking or feeling which made me insecure I started doubting whether she cared about me and yeah it ended I still send her the odd message and she responds but she never initiates We re in different countries now but I d really love to see her again I ve been trying to make sense of a recent relationship and am wondering if my ex may be autistic,autism

1512,Having come across some research from 2018 internet survey on autism I started categorising the findings to see if control was a factor So below are the general findings and my interpretation if we as autistic people have control or if it is controlled by others To start with what might be considered under our control We are more likely to be atheists in our control We don t believe vaccines caused autism in our control We are open and inclusive of LGBTQ in our control But We are generally happy to discuss autism Others largely do not discuss autism with us not our control We don t like want ABA the suppressing kind not in our control We struggle with employment not in our control We take too long to get diagnosed not in our control We struggle in school even when we do not have learning difficulties not in our control We feel empathy more intensely Others don t think we feel empathy not in our control Is the conclusion valid that in key aspects we lack control We are not legally represented Is lack of control not a key contributor to anxiety Anyway keen to see what your take is You can find the survey analysis here http autisticnotweird com 2018survey View Poll https www reddit com poll 18wp0yb Research seems to indicate that we are not the problem,autism
1513,I'm not self diagnosing but I think I definitely have autism I started thinking about it maybe 5 years ago My psychiatrist once tested me for bpd but we also found out my cognitive functions are miserable I do have many symptoms I'm 23 years old by the way Everytime I watch videos from my childhood there was definitely something wrong with me but my parents didn't notice I don't blame them though as I said it was 23 years ago My dad has OCD I'd like to get tested for autism because I know it would help to understand many things about me and everything would make sense autism testing,autism

1515,I suspect I have ADHD and possibly autism but haven't been diagnosed and I just need to know if im weird for this or not I've always found it difficult to talk with other ppl for multiple reasons 1 I struggle to find words to describe what I need to communicate whatever It may be especially emotions and internal things because my brain is keeping track of so many different things so I often have to resort to curse words and very simple vocabulary even tho I'm extremely good at writing essays or stories 2 Whenever I have a convo with someone that's able to scratch an itch in my brain I shake very lightly have a huge smile on my face and want to clap my hands and giggle and show the other person I'm that kind of happy but I got ridiculed for it once I can't find an explanation for it as it never happens with anything else and I've spoken to others about it but it leads to nothing There's more but idk if anyone will even notice this paragraph I just need help figuring this out I have a certain behavior and would like to know more about it,autism

1518,I started suspecting I might be autistic a couple of years ago I've taken all the online self assessments multiple times Always got kind of borderline answers 30 on ASD 113 on my last RAADS-R both autistic and NT traits on the aspie quiz etc Some of the reasons I figured I couldve been autistic Some sensory stuff related to noise when I was younger I couldn't stand my sister's snoring when we shared a room Like crying had to leave the room kind of couldn't stand it Though that's better as an adult And I really dislike sounds like scraping ice Our freezer has ice all over the shelves and stuff and whenever I have to take anything out of there it scrapes I've gotten more used to it now but every time I take something out of there I have to like roll my tongue If that makes sense I don't even really know why I stim Sometimes I rock I'm constantly shaking my legs playing and picking at my fingers and lips I've been doing this thing now where I literally don't use chapstick just so I can play with the skin on my lips I LOVE fidget stuff Like I get weirdly excited when I get any kind of slime or clicky toy or really soft thing I can hold and rub with my fingers I was always EXTREMELY quiet in school My username is thequietone because that's a name some people called me in middle school My teacher would put my name on the board sometimes for group projects and on more than one occasion I've heard people be like we have a my name in this class I only ever really talked to my couple of friends And as silly as this reason sounds whenever a boy came up to me I could not talk Like I almost went silent Same thing with people I didn't know Someone would hold a door open for me and when I went to say thanks it would come out so quiet that they couldn't hear me anyway And for a while when I was little I felt like I physically couldn't say certain phrases Things like happy birthday or thank you and I had to really force it out It just felt too awkward I guess A lot of the times when my family went to a friend's house or a birthday party I was hanging out with the adults instead of the kids Though whether that was social awkwardness or me being too attached to my mom is difficult to say I also had and have really bad separation anxiety so idk I always got pretty attached to my things more so as a child but even still to an extent I used to bang my head on the wall table as a toddler for no reason Like just randomly walk or crawl up to a wall prop myself infront of it and just kind of bang my head a couple times I've had anxiety since I was like 2 years old No real reason nothing triggered it I've just always been very anxious I way prefer text over call cause I can take time to think about and go over my answer Calls make me anxious because I feel awkward and worry I won't know what to say I've had lots of long awkward silences while talking to people I've had chronic constipation since I was an infant They never figured out why Which I didn't think really meant anything but apparently that can be related to autism based on some studies I've found and from listening to other people's experiences I have at least one sibling with ASD I suspect two but my other siblings is undiagnosed And I've been told I have mild OCD traits by a therapist I used to see But I've never felt like I had a lot of meltdowns or shutdowns I might've when I was younger and DEFINITELY had BAD meltdowns through puberty but I figure that's just bad hormonal stuff I don't have a lot of bothersome sensory problems Little ones here and there but I don't know that I would say they interfere with everyday life And I've never been one to have big hyper fixations I have stuff I love that I'm really interested in and like to talk about but idk if I would say it's to that extent The closest I've had was when I was younger and I was very obsessed with a certain celebrity Like very I had information about him which looking back probably wasn't true anyway lol about things I'd found online like where he was born which hospital things like his supposed blood type sounds creepy I know and he was basically all I talked about Like I was very quiet in school until someone mentioned him and then people would think I was weird because of how excited and suddenly talkative I would get But it faded and I figured it was just normal teenage girl being obsessed with famous teen boy heartthrobs I had an evaluation about six months ago It was with an older man I'd found online who was willing to do it with my insurance He gave me a couple of papers talked to me for about fifteen minutes and then wrote on the report that I DID have ADHD-PI and that I had traits similar to what someone autistic might have but don't fit the criteria I figured once I got evaluated I would move past it Another mental health professional I see said he did enough testing to rule it out he gave me the ASD and two other autism specific papers to fill out plus some others for ADHD and just general mental health But I keep coming back to it Idk why I feel like I'm trying to be special or account for why I do some of the things I do I don't have symptoms as bad as my siblings and they were worse when I was a kid So I try to remind myself of those things and the evaluation but I keep convincing myself that he didn't do enough and I could still be autistic Idk why and I feel really bad for it I don't want to claim I deal with something that other people actually do struggle with including my own family Or accidentally be one of those people who like sees a couple of tiktoks or something and goes gee I must be autistic too beause I do x or something like that I've even asked a few people who are autistic if I should get a second opinion at some point and even they said that if the psychologist said I wasn't then he's probably right But I don't feel satisfied I keep thinking there's still a possibility I have ASD or BAP or something to that affect And I know it doesn't matter in the end Labels are just labels But I just keep coming back to it and it makes me feel like kind of a bad person Like I subconsciously want it or something People keep

1519,Hello everyone For some time now I've been wondering what love is and if I'm in love I've always considered myself asexual aromantic so being in love has never really been something I considered up until this point I have a good friend I'm not sure if I can consider them my best friend because they have other friends as well as a best friend that's not me but we talk to each other the entire time we're awake every day We've met online and haven't met each other in person yet but they are always very vocal about their dating experiences and things like that In the beginning I was just doing my best to comfort them and cheer them up when they were feeling down but currently I'm finding myself thinking more and more that I could do that Taking them out on dates and doing things they like and not wanting them to go date someone else I consider them attractive and very pretty and am very sure that I like them as a person and a friend but I'm not sure if it goes beyond that or not I want to know if I'm just overreacting and that's just me being overprotective of a friend because I don't want to be left behind or something As with love I have basically no experience with friendship friends so I'm just very confused by all of this Maybe someone can offer some advice or share similar experiences Thank you for anyone who takes time to listen to my silly ramblings Am I in love,autism
1520,TLDR Please read the info before making assumptions Aspergers was not invented by the Nazis but was a later term that was effectively Low support needs Autism Further to that more research has surfaced to say Hans was not complicit in the Nazi regime Information is all below with links to Articles and studys Latley I've seen more and more comments denouncing the diagnosis of Aspergers sybdrome as Asperger's was a term made by nazis based on usefulness I am entiewly unsure where this has come from Its weird Firstly the diagnosis aspergers itself was more or less a thing in the DSM IV Around the 90s Further to that the term itself only came into existance in the late 70's This first means The term Aspergers flat out didn't exist in the 40s The term Autistic Psychopathy or in other translations Autistic with Personality disorder was used Lorna Wing coined the term Asperger's syndrome in 1976 and is also credited with widely popularizing the term in the English-speaking medical community in her February 1981 publication of a series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms On top of this there seems to be a rise of people who are entirely Adamant that Hans himself Was a nazi Yet this has been debated and even critisized From what i gather a large portion of this information came from Herwig Czech See below This claimed that Hans was a Nazi involved in Eugenics https molecularautism biomedcentral com articles 10 1186 s13229-018-0208-6 However Some time after this came under scrutiny by Dean Falk Dean Made an article explaining why Hans was Not complicit in the Nazi Regime and countered many points https link springer com article 10 1007 s10803-019-03981-7 Herwig Responded to this article not long after claiming it was full of mistranslations And after this Dean did a coubter response where they refuted all of their points Point by Point This brings a very interesting perspective that Hans was very likely Not a nazi or part of the party Yet this information is willfully ignored in favour of calling hima nd any assocation to him Nazi diagnositics Counter Response from them https link springer com article 10 1007 s10803-019-04099-6 Misinformation regarding the term Asperger's Syndrome aswell as Hans Aspergers,autism

1524,Hi so I was diagnosed with Asperger couple months ago and I'm still in the process or reviewing certain things in my life that I previously just labeled as okay weird I have a question to those of you who experience synesthesia as it can be connected with ASD I don't think I am a synesthete I mean okay my mind does generate some loose connections between words and abstract feelings concepts but I don't think it's exactly what synesthesia is It seems much more normal and unspectacular than what I think synesthesia is However I've been thinking about a dream I had couple years ago that stayed with me In the dream I was scratching a sweater in the same way one would be playing a musical instrument dream logic I know Anyway in my dream I was expecting to hear the music but not only did I hear the music that sounded like a classical orchestera but I could also see the colours that were generated along with the music coming off the sweater Different tones had different colours and it was so beautiful the strings of coloured light were raising up to the sky like smoke or norther lights It felt absolutely fantastic like a pleasant surprise but longer My question is would you consider it a synesthesia experience Does synesthesia even happen in a dream Or did I just have a vivid dream those happen to me quite often amp x200B posted also on r Synesthesia Synesthesia in a dream,autism

1540,Hoping someone can give me some insight to this My ND friend got upset with me NT over making plans and cancelling plans and we had a falling out because of this For context he started to become busy a few months ago that he can t be bothered to make concrete plans with me for days we d block to hang out but he is able to go on social events which I m assuming he made plans for It didn t used to be like this Usually we d text within the week to chat about what we want to do on the weekend Since this started happening I had to make changes in my priorities and decided that blocking a day we ll hangout on Sunday is not plan enough for me there has to be something concrete and I ll cancel it if something else comes up I communicated it to him that I get really anxious if there are no concrete plans but he still kept doing it so I started cancelling on him I don t cancel plans out of spite I do this because sometimes we end up watching a movie in the theater as a last minute plan when I could ve gone kayaking with other friends instead for example Meanwhile he d be out at a social event the night prior and I end up doing something I m not particularly that excited about doing because he can t be bothered What I ve done then is if we talk about hanging out on Sunday but something interesting comes up and there s nothing concrete 3 days prior with him I cancel our plans So it s not even last minute I give him time to adjust make other plans I then noticed that he started being unresponsive to me and apparently he got upset over this he said it s happened 3 times and he s over it Now he s just completely blowing me off I understand that change is hard for NDs but I know that he himself has cancelled plans with his friends family I also know that friends have cancelled on him and I ve not seen him become upset like this so I don t understand why he s reacting this way I tried to talk to him about this to understand and see how we can compromise and he got very upset that I m referencing his behavior with other people You re using what I tell you against me when I m just saying that friends sometimes have to cancel plans it s normal I also told him that I can t anymore prioritize him We used to date and in the past I would schedule plans around my time with him But he broke up with me so I don t understand his reaction to the boundary I m setting Can someone please help me understand this I sent him an email to explain why I m doing this and what needs to change but he didn t like that I sent him an email which probably overwhelmed him Getting upset over cancelling plans,autism

1543,Adderall has been helpful in increasing my social tolerance and masking both at work and in my personal life However it can also boost negative moods and especially burnout for me at the end of the day I understand masking comes at a high cost if I'm masking harder this just sets me up for total mental exhaustion I've gotten regretfully mean unempathetic and highly temperamental It is rare thankfully but my mood can shift instantaneously I can go from super light-hearted cheerful and fun to the worst person that isn't me at all Alcohol certainly is a catalyst for disaster It seems to happen especially if I ask for an accommodation or attempt to establish a boundary and it is disrepected or ignored and even more so if I've been feeling depressed or stressed by other things I need to remain careful when I decide to take the medication I am curious about alternatives I know getting plenty of routine sleep and keeping a good diet helps curtail my mood swings And also an increase in self-awareness that I am unfortunately learning more about the hard way Autism ADHD Adderall and Alcohol,autism

1546,I've always been very different from my siblings For starters they're almost 10 years older than me so I've always felt left out They were always doing things together and had the same interests parties fashion drinking stuff like that Meanwhile I was a little nerd who liked reading and playing video games They made fun of a lot of stuff while I was growing up my hair my clothes my special interests the stuff I posted online the books I liked etc I never felt like I could protect myself from those comments snapping at them usually meant even more jokes and my parents didn't really do much about it Things got a bit better when they graduated college and moved out I wasn't particularly close with any of them for many years For the last 2 years though my sister is living with my mom my grandma and me It's been a nightmare She's very noisy compared to the three of us She doesn't communicate things clearly she just snaps at me that I don't help with chores or other stuff that I didn't even know she needed help with Or she tells me that I should be grateful that she did the dishes or something else that I didn't even ask her to do in my place The worst part is her boyfriend He's even louder than she is and they're always fighting over the phone When he visits during the weekend I can't even relax because my headphones can't block out all the fighting Holidays have become a nightmare as well because my older sibling brings her husband and her 8yo son here All the noise and music and people make me wanna scream They don't seem to understand that all these things happening at the same time make me feel overwhelmed They don't understand that I need time alone to feel normal again after all the noise they made so they complain that I don't spend time with the rest of the family Nobody in my family understands anything about autism and I'm just tired of hearing complaints about who I am I used to think that I could wait a bit until I had a higher paying job and then move out But now I just want to get out of here and stay far away It sucks because my mom my grandma and I have always been close but now I feel like I can't be anywhere near them if that means that my sisters will be around to complain I'm very tired of my siblings,autism

1548,I ve had this thing for a while now where I feel this major dissonance between myself physically and myself internally I m assuming it has something to do with masking If I had to try and explain it I often wish I could just be an entity embodying my interests and thought processes rather than a human with a brain Cause sometimes I ll be on instagram or YouTube or something having a really good time looking at stuff related to the things that make me super happy Maybe it s Omori or Mlp or just the 2 000 playlist of videos I have saved on YouTube that I ll sometimes just watch over and over again And then I actually get up and look at myself and I have to like remember that I m in a flesh body And so because of this sort of dissonance I have this really strong need to get others to understand the things I like the way I understand them and for them to know exactly the reason why something is so important to me even if it s this super small niche part of me All of these things build up this identity that I perceive myself as that is really hard to accurately portray to others when all they see is another human Does anyone get what I mean This stuff is really hard to articulate without sounding absolutely insane Is this kind of dissonance I get between my internal and physical self an autism thing,autism

1552,Apparently the face reveal trend attracted a troll brigade To deter the invasion our Mods turned off all attachments Wrong move This is our space Outsiders should never influence what we do in here Yet that is precisely what happened By extinguishing all non-textual posts bullies bound our freedom and inflicted mass-muzzling upon our domain Why give them this power The world is designed to deprive our peace to Be We must not deprive ourselves in the spaces that we designed for us The inability to share images links or videos stifles the exchange of information and personal expression Meanwhile the face reveals promote self-acceptance at least for me For the first time I see people do what I do in photos make my facial expressions have a similar look in their eyes and normalize the unconventional I have never felt less alone in my traits more among my own kind and more inspired to own my oddities than by looking through these faces My misfit wife is also feeling affirmed to see women like her Moreover humanizing the usernames fosters kinship We get to meet our community members in a way that doesn t overwhelm an online Autism convention I haven t a clue whether anyone feels similarly though the turnout speaks to its positivity Mods I implore you not to let trolls oppress us through the proxy of this decision Don t let bullies push us into hiding DO NOT LET THEM WIN P S The reason that I didn t join the face reveals is my physical state Once I emerge from severe burnout I will post a comparison of burned out vs recovered me that is if this sub chooses to defy rather than defer to trolls This sub succumbed to external oppression Mods please reconsider,autism

1567,HIII My name is Angel and one my current special interests is the controversial rapper lil darkie I get a lot of hate from people who have missed the satire in darkie s music and judge him based off the song titles album art or experimental style without actually reading the lyrics I find the lyrics in music extremely important but I understand that not everyone does and experimental music is hard to listen to for many I would never hate on someone for just not liking his music But why do so many people have to be hateful I ve been called racist violent homophobic abelist etc or just a troll for liking lil darkie I find it ridiculous because darkie hates on the people who encourage all thoes things in his music I guess most people are missing the sarcasm I mean even his entire last tour was themed around his dark army which is waging a war on violence without killing a single soul the guy is a peaceful indian hindu who speaks about his experiences with being a victim of racism violence homophobia sexual assault drug addiction poverty etc while also boasting his unrepresented religion and culture in dozens of songs which I think is awesome Either I ve been harassed and insulted for liking him his music or I ve just been straight up assumed as a troll because darkie is my pfp and barred before I could even defend myself I had a ex of mine tell me he would never listen to a rapper with lil in their name bc it s basic but darkie calls himself that as a form of reclamation his racist bullies called him little darkie as a kid He proceeded to demean me and insult me and my music taste it was upsetting Has this happened to anyone else with a controversial or hated special interest anyone else with a unpopular special interest,autism

1628,First I want to say that as of now I don t have an official diagnosis for autism only for ADHD though my parents told me I had Asperger s as a child which I know is an outdated term but I just want to give context to the situation Basically I don t have issues talking with people for the last few years but for New Year s Eve I had a very busy shift I work in customer service and then went out to hang out with some friends First at the end of my shift I found it mentally hard to form any complete sentence and the act of talking felt laborious It s the next day and I literally can t stand the idea of talking or even going out and being around people My mom tried talking to me and could only muster one word responses A friend made me take the RAADS R test and I passed the minimum score for having autism so I m curious if this is something I should look into more or I m just being an introvert Would love some insight if possible Am I going Nonverbal Mute,autism
1629,I will be brief I moved out of my mom s house because me and my son were both being hurt there I live with my friend William who Robert my son doesn t know at all TL DR my son asked for a diaper today and I m really worried We recently moved how do I help him handle this big change At time of writing Robert is okay with this place but he won t leave my room We share a room So on days he stays here with me 3-5 days whenever his mom is working he just hides in my room He s been here for about 10 days in total He won t even leave the room to go potty his potty is here in the room Today and the reason I m asking is he is out of diapers and poops pretty freely but he has to be PEAK comfort Otherwise he ll just hold it until his body forces him to poop on the potty He pooped here twice so far and today he asked if he could have a diaper and that worried me a lot I don t want him to regress especially since he s going back to school tomorrow tuesday We have his top 3 favorite toys here alphabet letters play-doh and iPad and we go bowling and visit the local playgrounds often But I m going through a lot right now too I know how to make ME comfortable when I m anxious But if he stays here he starts getting anxious after a few days I probably need to pick up a small table and some chairs for him but that s at least 2 weeks away What can I do now besides more outside games EDIT His mom doesn t like talking about this stuff it makes her really anxious And I need her help while I m going through this big change I don t want her to worry that her son is going to start regressing if he stays here How do I make my son 4M more comfortable after a big move,autism

1632,As the title suggests I am an autistic teenager struggling with exam anxiety My anxiety is at a high which makes it much harder for me to cope and lowers my tolerance to sensory stimuli My meltdowns and shutdowns have been much worse than usual recently I was hoping that someone could give me some advice on how to calm this anxiety because it's really taking over my life I know that these exams are not the end but for some reason I am still panicking I have been doing a good amount of revision each day but overthinking keeps me up at night I have a separate room and extra time for my exams as access arrangements too but for some reason it's not the exam itself but the build up to it that is making me anxious If anyone has any advice I would be very grateful autism and exams,autism
1633,I keep getting ads for the Oodie and am really interested in getting one but every single one has a sherpa lining which is just a no-go for me Sherpa makes me VERY hot and itchy within minutes of wearing it and once it starts to mat I can t wear it at all The only product I ve found that doesn t have the sherpa lining is the Comfy Dream but the adult sizes are too big and the kids are just a few inches too short I m 5 1 and want it to fall near my thighs or knees which would be about 35-ish inches long I m willing to go to a tailor if need be but I d love to look up other options if they exist It drives me absolutely nuts that trying to search for one seems impossible since google seems to only use keywords instead of the actual full sentence so hoodie blanket without sherpa will only pull up ones with that lining Oversized blanket hoodie that DOESN T have sherpa,autism

1635,Hello My daughter is 5 and she really hates having her hair brushed or brushing it herself I know this is a really common sensory issue This morning she mentioned to me that the part she hates the most is the scraping noise the brush makes when it goes through a tangle Does anyone know of a brush that is quiet or at least quieter We normally use brushes from the knot dr We ve used the wet brush which is better but she doesn t like how slippery the brush is to hold even when dry Tysm Quiet hairbrush,autism
1636,I m in the process of facial hair growing in but too patchy to just leave it does anyone else struggle with the feeling when the stubbly hair comes back through but love the feel when it s longer And does shaving more often help it thicken faster Or grow more evenly Also for when it is actually thicker how do you keep it sort of short without shaving it all off please don t laugh at this I don t have a father figure to ask or help with this stuff I ended up cutting my face a good many times trying to learn to shave Facial hair,autism

1640,This might sound weird since a lot of autistic people love their fixations but I hate mine Mine is Yakuza right now I've found that I begin to hate everything that isn't related to my current hyperfixation and its the only thing that can bring me happiness For example I love nerdy stuff like power rangers and trasformers and kamen rider but when a different hyperfixation comes into my life I begin to forget everything I love and focus on this one type of media until I get burnt out and its nothing but boredom Why cant i just have multiple interests all active at the same time I hate hyperfixations,autism

1644,i m a level 2 for social communication and level 3 for repetitive and restricted behaviour so i don t really have an overall level still my psych said you re a level 2 3 on the cusp of a 3 my main point i have such a regimented routine and i get so stressed out if people try to mess with it i m a full-time uni student australia and i work twice per week as a casual in a job that involves my special interest even when im not at work or uni and im doing nothing i have a few things throughout the day i do 1 walk the dog on a long leash on a grassy field for 20 minutes with 10 minutes for on-leash training 2 go to the gym for up to 90 minutes for strength training 3 cook lunch and have leftovers for dinner i always complain that i have basically no friends my one friend lives interstate and the other one both autistic lives 10 minutes away from me she is unemployed and always asks to hang out during the week in the daytime although im free i get really stressed out when she does this but offer an alternative to hang out on a friday afternoon or weekend this is achievable for me because my routine doesn t really exist during the weekend i just feel bad because my routine is so rigid i HATE it when people try to spend time with me during the day with this friend in particular she sets a time but never sticks to it so i wait around and waste time when i could be doing the things i need to do I GET SO UPSET GUYS this is so hard but i only truly feel good when im so regimented when i spoke to my psychologist about it i was even crying rigid routine,autism
1645,I know this definitely sounds weird but hear me out I completely understand that snapping to get service workers attention and anything in that sort of context is not okay I thought this would be a good question to ask the community So I have a job where I take calls and schedule patients for an office that I work from home It can be very demanding and I could be taking call after call for a while without any breaks My husband and I have a German shepherd who is still pretty young and likes to get into things It was one of those times were I was taking call after call and she was getting into something I was all the way across the room from my husband and I snapped my fingers to get his attention since I was working with a pt He looked up and I pointed to our dog After I had gotten through the calls he told me that snapping to get his attention was rude I apologized and I asked him why was it rude He said that snapping was rude in general and I asked him what was I supposed to do since I was on the other side of the room I couldn t easily get up and tap him on the shoulder and I wasn t able to use my voice either since I was on a call I wasn t trying to be rude at all I didn t feel like there was a better option to communicate to him He didn t have any other ideas for alternatives I also asked a friend and she wasn t sure either Should I never use snapping as a form of communication Are there any alternatives I ve had this issue in the past with others and I ve never meant to be rude Is it rude to snap your fingers to help you communicate,autism

1661,I m a 19 y o guy with L1 autism and my entire life I ve struggled with forming connections with people I had small friend groups when I was younger and that was perfect for me but when I was 13 I shut down from a combination of other severe mental health issues and my autism and since then I haven t had friends More recently I ve been able to improve on my social anxiety a lot and I have an easier time talking with people But even now that I can easily be friendly and talk to people I really struggle to hold conversations and I seem to be missing whatever it is that you need to connect with another person I worry that missing out on so much social development from the past 6 years has further ruined any shot I had in the first place I m not sure if this is even something solvable for me being autistic but I m deeply deeply lonely and want to do whatever I can to try and improve my situation I d like to hear from anyone what you ve done or how you ve been able to make these connections if possible Thank you How do you form connections with people,autism

1683,So I M20 was trying to apply for my first job the other day a petrol station night shift uk and it had a thing I could apply for called accessibility and accommodation and I was asking my family if I need that as I have anxiety autism and bouts of agoraphobia so I struggle to talk to people and need to wear headphones all the time and my sister f25 said no I don't cause I can just get over it and that they're only talking about physically disabled people like ones in wheelchairs She said I'd have to learn to live without them and when I said that's not possible she started ranting about how she obviously knows what autism is because she has adhd and she said it shouldn't be an excuse not to do things But I feel like it's not an excuse Most of the times people say I'm using an excuse it's actually just a reason and then they get upset that it's the same reason every time like it's just one time use and is gonna magically go away Idk maybe I just don't know has anyone here slowly stopped being overwhelmed enough by everything to be able to stop wearing headphones Oh and she also constantly tells me that masking is good for me and that I should be doing it more better I don't think that's true either is it It just makes me so tired I had to drop out of college from masking so much I just shut down so that cant be true either can it Ty Also hope this isn't hard to read I'm not great at putting down thoughts and hope it's not too long Can you just get over needing to wear headphones everywhere,autism
1684,My friend recently started an argument with me where she attacked me for being rude in public Basically because I had a monotone voice didn't smile and looked annoyed when speaking to cashiers If I come up to pay say hello in monotone voice and look down say thanks and then leave is this considered rude She says it's extremely embarrassing for her to be with me in public because of it and I'm confused as to why Is there something I'm missing I thought being respectful meant not disrupting anything and being polite Apparently I'm also really disrespectful for looking at a clothing item in a clothing shop and then saying it's ugly Am I not allowed to say a store's clothing is ugly infront of the workers Am I disrespectful to store workers,autism

1722,so I m 18F and I ve come across autistic content on different social media platforms and realized that I do resonate with a lot of them So I started doing more research and i think autism might be what explains my unexplained outbursts and other flaws of my character and just my entire life growing up but I don t know what to do with this i come from a south asian immigrant family who fled from war and don t really prioritize mental health my parents think it s stupid and have very narrow mindsets that i cannot change All the times I ve ever broke down in front of my parents I ve been chastised for being overdramatic and I feel so worthless at times so getting an actual diagnosis is currently not an option for me but what are some resources or way I can help myself as a someone who may be autistic What ways have you been coping with how the world treats autism and how your brain works Thanks and happy new year I think I might be autistic and I don t know what to do,autism

1726,For context I am 30 and was diagnosed Aspie at 5 years old For I don't know how long now I feel like I have always had problems with overthinking and getting stuck in a looping train of thought of many different things mainly to do with my life whether it be to do with my career my hobbies interests or something that has happened in the past recently To try and explain this better and perhaps give an example I am a learning technologist for a university better known as a learning instructional designer but a job that's fairly unique in the UK and when I am not doing that I play video games watch TV Anime and read in my spare time I also try my best to have a productive side which will involve working out or learning something new in the week i e getting better at coding or designing for the sake of my job etc So mentally I try to separate these things in my head almost like I'm giving them labels So on one hand I am a learning technologist on the other I am someone who plays video games likes watching TV etc but if I feel like some of these things spill into one another somehow then that feels disorienting to me and I have to mentally put the pieces back into place so they fit into consecutive order Has anyone else had this similar experience with how much they ruminate overthink How best do you deal with it I have read up about Cognitive Behavioural Therapy before has this helped you manage your symptoms Most people have also suggested meditation which I plan on trying since it seems to come up a lot here Rumination Thought Looping Overthinking What are your experiences How do you cope,autism

1738,I m in a loving relationship of 10 years and was just diagnosed a few weeks ago but my mental health has been on the decline since COVID and it s impacted our relationship Lemme start by saying my wife is fucking fantastic and not at all in the wrong She s an incredibly patient kind person but still she has to be a patient a lot lmao Things are good but they re not great and I don t think I m capable of making her truly happy because of who I am at a fundamental level We have kids and most of the grief is from me struggling to rise to the level of structure my wife has lovingly carefully crafted for our kids She s very organized punctual and well-spoken who enjoys being alone and I m a giant puppy who has outgrown the lap My love comes in the form of squeezes kisses and yes random factoids and news bits when I don t have anything to say but want to connect with her in conversation but even then it s all out of love My love is like someone who brings you rocks they find on their walk I don t but it s an accurate analogy It s totally harmless but over time to the person I m loving the rocks accumulate they all start to look the same and kind of become routine After a while everyone I love is eventually like that s enough rocks thank you even though I put so much love and thought into every rock I gather I wish people would see the rock isn t what I m trying to give but they focus so much on the fucking rock If someone brought me rocks I d be like THIS IS THE COOLEST ROCK where on earth did you FIND THIS and I would treasure each one and show my collection to my friends Who knows I might even get into rocks even go to a rock convention They have a solid fanbase I might even name a few and keep them in my pocket so I can think of you every time I reach for my keys So yeah I m a bit much My love is active and hers isn t and we knew that going into this We dated for a long time before getting married because I was afraid of this but I couldn t articulate it The word we were looking for was dual wielding autism and combined adhd but here we are 10 years and 2 kiddos and a happy good but chaotic life She is the one for me on so many levels and I never want to live without her so this isn t about compatibility she sees beyond the rocks I bring her but she also complains about the accumulating gravel Sometimes I love her in ways she doesn t want to be loved and by that I mean it in the healthiest way I m talking wanting to spoon every night give her back scratches constantly and a random batch of 30 white hot memes Like I want to go snuggle her right now but things have been so stressful that we ve just been like roommates I ve made a ton of progress when it comes to boundaries making sure I clean up after myself and the kids and I do my best to contribute as a parent but I struggle with remembering to the point that I m unreliable She gave me specific advice on ways she wants to be loved like thoughtful gifts and acts of service and the past year I ve really focused on that But my gifts are hit or miss one shirt she wears constantly but I haven t seen the other three since I gave them to her She calls me her sweet roomba who goes through the house cleaning but the house is never clean because it s true I try so hard but I m just not to her level and no one in my family is we re talking counters washed and carpets vacuumed daily dishes never in the sink hyper clean I will never physically be capable of her level of clean It s hard to have so much love so deep of an ache and longing for my best friend and to also need to pause and realize that right now my love might be annoying or need to be tolerated and increasingly coming to the conclusion it s best left to myself So much of who I am is left on the cutting room floor and even still there s still shards of tactlessness and to go through all the effort of not only loving but trying to transform that love before delivery it s actually a super lonely feeling I know she feels lonely too we all want to be loved in the ways we need it and I m just not capable of that sometimes This is a first world problem of autism if ever there was one but it s one that really makes me question my purpose my meaning it s not a small problem And it s not going away as long as I live I dunno What s worked for you guys Do you have any advice for someone just starting to figure it out after all these years of struggling Do you find yourself having to prune your love,autism
1739,So I ve 17FtM been living with the assumption for the past couple years that I probably either have adhd or autism Don t worry I don t go telling people I have these things Because I really don t know Every aspect of the healthcare system where I live is terrible It s also really hard to be diagnosed with these things here An example my 7 year old cousin very clearly has adhd But doctor s excuses to not test him is that he focuses at school Which as a lot of us probably know that doesn t mean anything Another example I have some physical issues but doctors ignore me and tell me I m fine and won t actually do tests on me But anyway in order for me to be tested by someone who WILL take me seriously and do a THOROUGH assessment it will cost hundreds of dollars What if i pay for it and end up not having either What would ve been the point I m not saying I WANT to have autism and or adhd I m just saying that from hearing other peoples experiences and hearing and seeing the symptoms and relating to people with these disorders it makes sense that I would have at least one of them as well I also know that some countries won t let you immigrate there if you have an autism diagnosis and although not many it s sometimes hard to find out this information online I may like to move to japan either for a couple of years or for a while and I m unsure if they let people with autism move there Anyway I m confused and afraid should I spend all of this money to seek a diagnosis Or just keep living my life being confused and not actually knowing Here s a list of my official mental psychological diagnosis anxiety symptoms of depression ocd arfid bpd I need to be reacessed as an adult and gender dysphoria I m afraid to seek a diagnosis,autism

1770,I don't know if this stuff is allowed here or if I picked the right flair but if it's not I will delete it I'll try to keep it as short as I can My old school was very hard on me I started it in the 1rst grade and graduated in 6th I'm in 9th grade now and I still think about it all the time They just didn't know how to deal with me There's so much I can't put it all in a reddit post but basically everyday was a nightmare They knew my triggers and purposefully did them to make me have a meltdown so they could take me out of class They had this very small room with another smaller room in it called the quiet room it was supposed to he to relax but they always forced me in there locked the gate it there and reset the timer everytime I cried I'd be in there for hours A lot of the time I'd like to talk with them to see what I did wrong so I could fix it but theh thought I was being smart and sarcastic There were times where I'd be trying to be nice like putting all the chairs back in after class bc I thought she'd like that but after telling her that I wanted to instead of going to the next class because she always tells us to do it but no one usually dose she blew up and sent me to the quiet room All this and along with never going to field trips because I was apparently dangerous to myself and others I never really had friends except for a few because I was almost never in class I was in that little room or the room outside it I really don't want this to be longer but you get the point Until I met my best friend after graduating to the school I'm at now I would still be hating myself today because I thought i was a bad kid I thought it was all my fault But they showed me someone as awesome as them could like someone like me they showed me I have value I'm unbelievably grateful for them And they also helped me let down my guard enough to get the courage to tell a bunch of strangers all this My question is was it trauma or just a really bad school I don't like to self pity and I know people have gone through worse some are nonverbal for Christ's sake But I don't think I'd be the person I am now if I was treaded better I still have nightmares and panic attacks about the place and I haven't even gone in it in 3 years and it's extremely hard to cry now Well I think this is long enough sorry for the long read and thank you for the patience Did I experience tauma,autism

1779,I didn't know what to eat today and had no energy to stand in front of the stove oven and make something from scratch since it's new years day and I pretty much drained all of it last night So I go to ask my sister what we should eat but I see she's already getting something out of the fridge as I tell her that I don't want to cook anything and was just about to ask her what to eat and half-jokingly suggested pizza as it's international pizza day She didn't want any pizza so Since I don't have any food of my own at home right now she then started offering loads of different stuff all of which needed some form of cooking so I just stand there in silence not knowing how to react since I already told her I don't wanna have to cook It also didn't help that she was pulling out pretty much every type of food she has overwhelming me with too many options that I didn't even want but didn't want to just say no and sound really rude So I just stand there overwhelmed and going more and more non-verbal as i also notice her getting frustrated and now I'm kinda sitting in my room unable to respond to anything or pick any food to order cause there are too many options in the app as well and I don't even know if I'm hungry anymore because of the whole situation As I'm writing this my sister wrote me a message saying she could go with me to the pizzeria near us but I don't know what to say or do Overwhelmed by food,autism

1786,I m sorry I don t really know what I m doing But I figured talking to others could help I m 33 years old and I discovered about two or three years ago that I was most likely autistic Now the idea didn t make complete sense as I am what society would consider higher functioning though dear god it really doesn t feel like it but then I discovered PDA autism and that slotted right in and made sense Right now I m having an issue with my family They are all probably also undiagnosed but as I have other mental health issues I m the only one who s really worked towards getting help Our house is incredibly tense and I realize I ve become kind of traumatized with everything happening and I tend to get bursts of anger when I get overstimulated and in the moment I do my best to explain to people that I m trying to be calm if they can just let me finish what I was trying to say but I apparently don t make any sense when I m worked up I m 5 10 250 lbs and loud So it s scaring my family I almost lost contact with my nephews because of a meltdown on Christmas Eve My younger adopted brother has some severe mental and physical health issues that cause him to steal and lie Cystic fibrosis and diabetes fetal alchohol spectrum disorder adhd Oppositional defiance disorder and through talking to him I think he also has PDA autism The difference being he has an entire team of doctors and I m on my own figuring everything out He s non med compliant and very combative and it makes life incredibly difficult to deal with Basically watching my brother slowly starve himself because he won t take his meds This has all led to an incredible amount of stress And then at Christmas everyone s hanging out and I watch the kid take a cookie and dip it in the big bowl of icing sugar for the gingerbread house So I told him not to do that he got mad at me and said it was Christmas so I was like yeah that doesn t mean you just dip shit in sugar My sister who doesn t live with us then told me that I wasn t his mother and it all exploded everyone yelling and me desperately trying to just explain but no one will shut up long enough for me to finish explaining I get told that I don t have a right to make others listen but that doesn t make sense why would they not want to hear the explanation You can t make a decision if you don t know what s happening I mean the kid stole four litres of apple cider and ended up in the hospital the week before Of course I m gonna try to stop him from killing himself I dunno what to do to make people understand I learn as much as I can about my disabilities so I can make life easier on others but no one wants to learn about them to help and they get tired of hearing me talk about it but I just want them to understand I have a crippling fear of being hated and this shit doesn t help Maybe I m a douche Idfk Any advice would be appreciated My solution is to move into residence at college but I m pretty sure I m actively in autistic burnout and should be getting help but I have to be diagnosed first and that s a whole shitshow on its own Help I guess,autism

1817,I'll start My idea is a revamp of the currently popular Gregorian Calendar Our home planet circles our home star approximately 365¼ times for each 360 revolution it makes around its axis Our primary natural satellite The Moon circles us in a tidally locked fashion once in roughly 28 of our days Taking those two numbers 365¼ and 28 into account it makes so much sense if we had 13 months of 28 days each The existing 7-day week would not only be retained but actually strengthened as each month would not be an invariant 4 weeks long In fact whatever day of the week January or whatever the first month of the year is starts with that will be the first of the month for the entire rest of the year Anyone need to make rent payments But wait I hear you yell 28 is not evenly divisible into 365¼ No number is Correct But even the current Gregorian calendar sucks eggs in this regard Because of the ¼ every four years we tack on an additional leap day to account for it But even that's not perfect and results in creeping errors that mean every 100 years we skip a leap day to stay properly on track but every 400 years is an exception to the exception and so is still a leap year The year 2000 was ordinarily supposed to be a leap year but was evenly divisible by 100 so was not but was also evenly divisible by 400 so it was again 13 28 364 So that means we just have one extra day in each standard year to account for two in a leap year keeping to the existing accounting of years and hacky adjustments How many people are staying home today because their companies recognize Jan 1 as a holiday Okay then There's your answer The extra day each year comes at the very beginning of the year and everyone world wide gets it as a day off It doesn't belong to any named month It can be a pseudo-month unto itself and we'll just call it New Year's Day It wouldn't be Jan 1 It would be its own thing Then for leap years tack on an extra day at the end of that year just before the New Year's Day of the following year It would just flow from one year into the next with an extra day of world-wide holiday recreation as New Year's Eve I don't really care about what each of the 13 months would be named To get away from the names of Roman Caesars and deities I'd be delighted to get back to the pattern of September December and make up new names based on number names but that's just me If we just decide on one new month name and shoehorn it in amongst the existing 12 I couldn't care less about what existing two months it insinuated itself between The lunar month would still have all of the same problems as the existing system since the synodic month time to complete one orbit by the universal frame of reference or 29 530589 days and nodal month time from one moon phase to the next occurrence of the same phase or 27 21222 days are so off and there's just no way to rationally adjust for that Essentially from month to month the moon phases are a little more than 1½ days later than 28 days Which is far more problematic to adjust for than 1¼ days every year Who's with me What are your Thinking outside of the neurotypical box ideas that are so bonkers they just might work but no way they'd ever be adopted by the rest of the world,autism

1819,I cant work more than 30hrs im autistic adhd cptsd and have scoliosis working is torture id rather die because i dont work full time i will never get paid above minimum wage which means working feels like slave labor ive been working since i was 12 only getting minimum wage after all these years is a slap in the face Because im canadian disability pay doesnt cover the insane housing prices and i wouldnt be able to afford to live anywhere anyway and since i live with my boyfriend im not allowed any assistance the government puts that responsibility on our partners ignoring the fact that no one on a single income here can support two people The financial crisis is ruining my life Im ready to kill myself and all i would need to fix that is MONEY I cant believe im ready to end my life over finances I really hope this all changes one day Canada giving us the option of live with 7 roommates and be constantly questioned if youre dating any of them and get your disability taken away if you cant prove youre not or die alone is such utter bullshit Its like they want us to kill ourselves Canada s lack of disability assistance makes me want to die I have no hope,autism

1824,Just for a change of pace from the face reveals which I am enjoying regardless we have a lot of diversity and that's nice to see I wanted to know about what everyone else's experience with diagnosis and then being open with it Id say I'm fairly open I'm lucky to live in a fairly open minded country but then again I'm pretty good at masking too so no-one ever suspects anything anyway How did you come to terms having ASD and when did you start becoming public with it,autism

1826,throwaway account so my fam doesnt find this and lecture me i don t act autistic enough i am a young fit attractive extroverted and bubbly woman I speak openly about being autistic and recently found out that a family friend of mine had shared an instagram post that i made about being autistic I was brought aside by that family to discuss my other concerning behavior of acting apathetic and without self-awareness They told me that I was flirting with somebody s boyfriend at their recent holiday party I had no idea again autistic I knew he had a girlfriend and was not trying to flirt with him I m just very friendly AND AUTISTIC They brought up my Instagram post and how they basically think I m handicapping myself and self diagnosing which is some sort of joke because I m obviously not autistic since I m such a social butterfly They told me that my behavior at their party made them feel uncomfortable that people could see me get touchy with somebody a public setting they told me that I lack empathy and need to work on this Not only am I hurt but I m genuinely disgusted by this We have been family friends for as long as I ve lived I grew up with this family as an extension of my own But to be told flat out that I am not what I say I am is not appropriate nobody except for myself and my doctors has the right to define who I am or what label I use This situation has forced me to seek out an official diagnosis when I initially opted out of getting one I m tired of trying to explain to people that I m different without a diagnosis i m tired of autistic people being told that we re rude or that we need to be aware of ourselves or how we are treating others when we express how difficult these things are for us I am an incredibly kind person and I know that and I would never do anything to make anybody uncomfortable I know that can still happen but to be told I lack empathy and that this is fixable is such a slap in the face There s nothing wrong with me and I don t need to be fixed I struggle in social situations and I will apologize for making people uncomfortable and I will always do my best to learn from those mistakes but to pull me aside and say I need to think about others was way too far I do think about others I just lack social awareness I m pissed that the world only sees autism as existing one way I do great at parties I m super bubbly like I said and very talkative That doesn t mean I m not autistic My autism caused me to be bullied as a kid and is an adult I ve had more meltdowns than I can count I bring fidgets places and have a hard time making eye contact but sometimes force myself to do it anyway Just because I can act normal and social situations and have fun while passing as neurotypical doesn t mean I m not fucking autistic I am so angry i don t act autistic enough,autism

1830,My daughter and I are both PDA 5 years back or so there was an app we used called Mothership which allowed us to assign tasks to each other It was nice because you could assign points rewards and you could see if the person completed things which helped me with accountability They went under though And I haven't found a suitable replacement There a lot of good apps out there but I'm looking for one that can assign tasks to each other remotely provide point rewards for prioritizing and recognizing difficulty but not money rewards the more gamified the better i like habitica and the like but it's missing the first bullet I can't get myself to assign my own tasks for very long Anyone found a good app or found another way to assign tasks to adults and kids with PDA without triggering them amp x200B Thanks Todo Apps for PDA,autism

1846,Hey I was wondering if anyone else in the spectrum had noticed issues with fine motor fatigue and drawing I didn t even realize this happens to me until it was pointed out on my assessment but in retrospect it makes a lot of sense my handwriting mainly gets very noticeably worse my hand gets sore after writing under a period of time I also happen to be an artist and I m pretty sure this fatigue is also noticeable when I draw lines being too stiff or too loose having to go over a certain line a bunch of times for it to appear the way I want it to I don t want to seem like I m making excuses for just having poor line work either figure drawing using the line of action does help improve this a little bit however I still find myself struggling making me think it s also attributed to fatigue I m just wondering if anyone else has this issue and how they ve accommodated worked with it or around it I d love you hear your thoughts Motor fatigue and drawing,autism

1854,It s getting really annoying just seeing peoples faces I m glad they feel confident enough to post a pic of themselves but it is both dangerous and annoying now It s dangerous because this is a sub where a lot of people open up about trauma and there are a lot of vulnerable people here who although it is just a selfie might put themselves in danger by following the trend especially fellow higher support needs autistics who may already struggle with the internet and privacy It s also annoying because a lot of people are in this sub to try get help for things but if their cry for help post is just drowned out by selfies and isn t answered then that s a bit unfair for them I know this is probably the 400th post but can we get a megathread for people to post their selfie things in,autism

1864,Hi Im from Spain 23 years old and I have asperger's yesterday after the twelve strokes I decided to go out I enjoy to go by myself at night alone to listen music I chase loneliness I smoked weed because Im an addict and after a while decided to throw the joint at the trash can and return home I don't like to smoke As Im returning home I hear a familiar voice I thought it was an old friend I was walking with my hoodie on wearing a buff that covered my face because I was cold and I like to feel hidden as Im coming closer to the voice of this group of people I pass by their side and they look at me this triggered my anxiety I remove my buff for respect and ask the name of who I thought it was who I heard he says no and I reply with I thought it was somebody else I guess they expected problems from me by the way I looked and heard as I walked faster to my home how they were talking about that also my physical psychomotricity is not the most accurate The way I walk or move the cold and because of being high I felt more clumsy with my movements anyway I arrived home with my heart beating fast feeling anxious because of this experience after that I have less desire to socialize than I already had Close to none I like to wear a hoodie on with buff I like to feel hidden but after yesterday I noticed that it produces the contrary effect maybe this experience is a nuisance anyway I needed to share this with somebody thanks for your time Completely Unsocial Bad experience,autism

1871,I posted earlier criticising the face reveal trend but now after scrolling and looking through it again I'm changing my opinion There are so many of us out there and all of us are so unique and so different it's really cool to be able to scroll through esp for us socially isolated folk and see people out there looking all kinds of unique It does criticise the idea that Autism has a look because it's showing us all that blatantly I worried that it'd turn into a hierarchical looks competition and didn't think that was good but as long as everyone is being accepting and kind which people are there is 0 problem at all What do you guys think about it I genuinely want to hear opinions from anyone who wants to give one Please be nice to others if they comment and make this a place to just openly discuss thoughts and opinions Reassessing the Face Reveal Trend,autism
1872,Hello I'm a college student and I have some accomodations for my exams like being in a different and quieter class But sometimes the students that come and go are very distracting and frustrating so I want to buy a noice cancelling headset Only thing I dislike about them is that I can hear all of my personal noise like my breathing my swallowing etc Since they're evaluations I'm not allowed my cellphone or my usual nc bluetooth headphones because of cheating So I was wondering if there was an in-between like a nc headset that came with some white noise or things like that in them A little bit like the white noise machines they have on Amazon but in a headset I can't be the only one with this issue I'm sure Thanks Noise cancelling with pre recorded sounds but not bluetooth,autism

1886,No research study before this has ever been able to assess this data before now According to the CIA's covert false selfie operation it turns out most autistic people are humans Some are cats and a few are hamsters but mostly it's humans Further studies will need to be conducted as to wether the animal Autists were exclusively autistic humans pets faked or simply have a predisposition for Reddit usage Its worth noting that the study is primarily tracking autistic Reddit users and won't be representative of all animal Autists Autistic animals have a far lower chance of being able to use the internet because they are either too big too small or too silly to use a keyboard The next studies should either focus on whether Reddit usage causes Autism in humans or vice versa Alternatively studies which trick Autists into revealing themselves but don't require access to tool say a collected survey and photographs could show to rate of non human autism outside Reddit J Try and enjoy this next year folks It's hard but try Welp It's official,autism

1900,Hello and happy new year I'm a 23 year old nonbinary fem presenting to others person located in the USA I'm a level 1 autistic person with no intellectual disability and I'm very good at masking even though I hate it At the current moment I work 40 hours a week in an office setting Monday through Friday 8am to 5pm It's not the epitome of where I want to be career wise but I appreciate the stability of the schedule and my salary and its also close to my home so every lunch I get to come and lay down in my safe space With that being said despite my salary being nice for someone my age the rising costs of living are making it hard to direct my money where I want it to go I want to start earning money that I can directly put into my for me only savings accounts Money that can go towards traveling paying the autism tax for different things cleaning services meal prep services taking my dog to the groomer vs bathing him myself etc and silly little treats like multiples of my favorite shoes and safe-foods If any of you are in a similar position of already working full time while having a secondary source of income what is it What type of work do you do I'm trying to open myself up to possibilities that are beyond working a closing inventory shift at a chain store or something I drive a compact and fuel efficient car so I've toyed around with the idea of being a delivery driver for a locally owned pizza place or something That would be nice because tips have the potential to be great and I opted for a locally owned shop to sort of remove myself from the corporate matrix feel that I already spend 40 hours a week in Thank you Does anyone have a second job,autism

1909,TLDR what's the point if you're not well known Anyone else kind of uncomfortable by them So I've noticed a lot of people doing face reveals and I just don't understand why What's the point in showing your face to a bunch of people on a subreddit that's completely unrelated to face reveals Maybe I'm missing something but I just don't get it I understand if you were super popular on the subreddit or well known for other reasons e g streamer singer etc and a face reveal is something that's been highly requested but if you're just some random person then what's the point Also does anyone else feel kind of uncomfortable looking at photos of people It's hard to explain but it's some kind of uncanny valley where they just look so lifeless Plus it's like they're staring at you and I guess I have the autism that doesn't like being perceived What's with the face reveals Why What's the point,autism
1910,I have never really seen this put this way so I m not sure if this is an autism thing or a me thing I have read that autistic people are upset when there is a change of plans and this is always presented as some kind of innocuous tantrum me a no reason kind of thing Like the person wants to be in control because they want to have the power That s not the way it is for me it s fine if someone else makes the decisions as long as they stick to them If I have planned for something I have worked out what could happen how I need to prepare gathering stuff what this means how it fits into my day etc When plans change all of that has to be recalculated and that is exhausting and honestly I hate doing Planning in and of itself is a time-consuming task and I don t know how long the planning going to take so how do you plan the rest of the day when you don t know how long the planning phase will take Then if you have to reschedule the day you don t know how long the rescheduling and all things associated is gonna take either Then my ADHD fucks me and I ll forget stuff despite my best efforts because one thing was out of order in my preparation habits Is this an autism thing or just me Edit to add this is also why I always do things a certain way I know this way works and I don t want to have to recalculate the variables of a new way Why plans going awry is stressful,autism
1911,The face reveal can be harmful because it is a popularity contest For example young and pretty people I noticed are getting more upvotes than those who were not Am I hurt that mine was ignored Yes I was and that is why I deleted it The thing is this should be a support group but voting for the prettiest face is not that At first I liked it and then realized it is a popularity contest and the prettiest are the winners It turned out to be like the rest of reddit Face reveal is biased towards people with pretty privilege,autism
1912, SELFIE,autism
1913,So this is something I am 100 sure is related to my neurodivergence but am not sure if it is popular among the community Unless I am executing a work like writing this post at a public space where it's best to sit e g at church or processing a unique scenery I almost always walk non-stop Roaming back and forth as they call it It's like walking keeps my brain working and thinking if I stop all of a sudden my thoughts become stagnant Like pistons of a ship if it stops moving then the ship too stops Although I often find it useful as it allows me to think more extensively I find that it's super tiring weakening my legs and sometimes hinders me from talking to people about my problems So because I find this as the default method to finding a solution I sort of repress my thoughts from others and people who have experience repressing feelings may know it exacerbates anxiety etc Does anyone here walk too often,autism

1916,Throwaway because I'm embarrassed English isn't my first language so please go easy on me So I'm 22 autistic and trying to get an apprenticeship in IT for summer 2024 I already attempted to get one for 2023 but was unsuccessful because I'm just not that good with job interviews Getting one this year is very important to me because I would like to finally move out and have my own income for once I thought asking a community full of fellow autistics and whoever else stumbles across this post tbh about the specifics and unspoken rules of applications and especially job interviews I've been told getting a job is mostly about saying the right phrases and I do not know the right phrases When they ask me to tell them about myself what kind of information are they asking about I'm name I'm 22 years old and I'm applying for this apprenticeship does not sound very convincing I don't have any IT related hobbies but I'm thinking of getting into one just to avoid any awkwardness What kind of answer should I give when they ask Why did you choose our company The real answer is Because I need a job but I can't just say that I've also been told I shouldn't bring up the benefits listed as a reason so now I'm just confused about what exactly I should be saying This one is specific to IT when they ask If a code you wrote doesn't work what do you do what should I say Last time I was asked that I replied that I would stay calm and try again and if it kept not working I'd ask for help I'm unsure whether that was right enough I'd also appreciate any advice for writing EXCEPTIONAL applications because to be honest I kinda suck at them I never know what to say except I'm reliable and good at maths If anyone has any more bits of advice let me know thank you for reading Desperately need advice for getting a job,autism

1946,apologies for the long post i just really needed somewhere to vent i 22 got an official medical diagnosis in october and felt so much relief afterwards i thought that i could finally move forward with my life as i d been suffering for so long and was hoping i could finally get some support less than a week after my diagnosis i managed to get a part time job after being unemployed for over a year things were really looking up for me i was scared of my coworkers disliking me but i like them and we re getting along well however its a pet store and i m struggling with working in retail i struggle with socialising and dealing with difficult customers and i dislike the actual company too sells cages hutches that are too small for the animals which i was unaware of before applying i really enjoy working with the animals though and the job has a lot of benefits but i can t ignore the problems of the company i was planning on staying at this job until i could speak to a therapist about it to help me i prefer speaking things like this through first and i want a perspective that s not from my parents the psychiatrist that diagnosed me sent a list of recommended supports to put in place for me to my local GP i told the psychiatrist that i ve had bad experiences with CBT and counselling so she recommended CBT and OT with a therapist with experience in ASD i thought that maybe i had bad experiences in the past because it was before i knew i as autistic so a therapist with ASD experience would hopefully help me yesterday i was speaking to the GP and he revealed that the ONLY option for me in my city using the NHS is our city s wellbeing service which only offers CBT and counselling i wouldnt be able to get a therapist specifically with ASD experience unless i pay privately and if i DO self refer myself to the wellbeing service i ll have to wait months and months and it doubt it will even help me also the only autistic adult services in my city have closed their waiting lists so i cant get help there i think the most frustrating thing about this situation is that i planned on speaking to a therapist to help me with making the huge decision of getting a different job and now that i know i cant do that i feel completely stuck i know i CAN look for a new job myself but it took over a year of unemployment to get this one i cant straight up quit before accepting a new role because i need money i just wanted a little bit of support someone that can help me break down a largely overwhelming process into small achievable steps i cant ask that from family and at this point i dont really have friends to turn to i m sure i ll move past this but i m fed up of having to do so much without professional help feeling kinda stuck,autism

1949,I couldn t find an answer to this on here already but I m sorry if I ve just missed it Hi I m someone 23M who s discovering neurodivergence and trying to work out the whole problem with accessing assessment etc Anyway in the meantime I m exploring things that might help me manage life a bit better and right now I m looking into using energy accounting spoon theory I love the idea and this might be a stupid question to ask but I m a bit stuck on how to go about it so I thought I d drop a post here When I m making my list of withdrawals deposits I feel like it s very day-dependent or even time-of-day dependent on how energy taking giving they are Like if I think about this on a morning where I ve woken up feeling a bit rough dysregulated it s going to be rated as a higher amount of energy taking But if I feel good when I m thinking about it it might barely be energy taking or might even be energy giving if I m in a good regulation state But obviously there s also the issue of sometimes I feel a bit better and then take on another task which pushes me over the edge and then I m just completely dysregulated and on the verge of overload shutdown meltdown I don t know if this makes any sense but basically I m asking anyone who uses energy accounting Do you guys find it easier to do this energy accounting daily and check on it through the day Or do you base the energy accounting on how you re feeling when you look at your task list at the start of the day even when there are moments where you might feel better throughout the day Or do you have a list with a firm number of how much energy it takes gives to do a task and work off that for all days I don t know if I managed to explain myself well there Sorry if I confused anyone Thanks in advance for any replies And Happy New Year I m hoping 2024 is a year of understanding myself better and less burnout hahaha How to go about energy accounting,autism
1950,I m 16 girl suspected autistic by an external school counsellor and have done heavy research into it She originally that mentioned it months ago and she works mainly around people who are neurodivergent she also has an autistic son I ve always thought as a child I was just shy until secondary school when I was 12 and I suppose I realised I m anxious Now I look back my whole life and realise I ve always been anxious in many ways I just don t remember the specific reasons for things When I was in primary school aged 5-7 there was this small ramp leading down to the school entrance coming off the main road pavement It always had 2 teachers at the top that would greet you and one further down Everyone s parents would always drop off their child say bye then the child would walk down alone or with a friend that would take about 15 seconds However I would ALWAYS walk with my dad down it After 2 years my dad wanted to fix this issue so slowly he d walk less distance and have someone down at the bottom of the ramp to greet me I would cry And I would always do this nervous stim on my ear where I d flap the top part in and out which my sisters found funny who were in secondary school I just don t understand why I was one of the only ones who had an issue doing this simple thing I loved all the teachers so it s not like I was scared of them and I don t think it s because I was severely attached to my dad it was just walking down that small ramp that was the issue with everyone there noticing me When I got into school I was much happier I think Please help me find reasons Anxiety as a child,autism

1969,Him and I have great communication and talk a lot between us But I ve just come here for some extra input We are also long distance so this can create its own set of unique challenges I ve been dating him for around 2 months and things are going very well and we are definitely on the way to a relationship exclusivity He is beautiful pure fascinating and dedicated The closer I get to him the more his autism is apparent He was diagnosed with PDD-NOS which I now know is outdated when he was a teenager and his symptoms are definitely less obvious and But I am really struggling with his directness and as I have CPTSD and am highly sensitive sometimes his lack of emotion and expression can make me confused and I jump to the wrong conclusions His abruptness I also find quite triggering and it comes across as rude at times An example of this is last night NYE was our last night together he s visiting me in the UK from the Netherlands I wanted to be very sentimental and just talk about how much I liked him and how lovely our time has been hopes for the new year etc but he was so tired and just had to sleep after midnight I felt offended because we are long distance and don t spend a lot of time together and for me this is very special and we must make the most of each other He just wouldn t listen and said he must sleep He just said wake me up if you need me I m here for you But I just wanted him to be there for me then but he didn t seem to read my indirect communication as I spent a long time in the bathroom crying I felt very triggered and as if I care about him more than he cares about me I m very expressive give a lot of compliments and I see this doesn t come naturally to him That s of course OK but I just need to adjust to this But I guess as someone with autism he doesn t really play games or lie hide truths about things He takes things very literally He seems to get confused when I need to hear things more than once and be reassured It doesn t make sense to him when I ask him to validate me Anyway Are there things that could be helpful to know about generally I want to tread carefully as I don t want to overwhelm him But at the same time I m part of the neurodivergent community with my complex ptsd and I have my unique set of triggers and needs I m dating a wonderful man with autism I m finding some things a bit challenging and just looking for some advice from other perspectives,autism

1976,I was diagnosed in 2018 with autism but it got removed later by mistake of professionals They didn t think i was autistic since i was masking for them They were not the ones that diagnosed me these were different people that removed it It shouldn t have been removed short and simple I ve tried to get it back but was denied retesting over and over and over again 4 times denied from public health care because of their mistake so i gave them up So I m wondering would i be diagnosed or self diagnosed when i tell people I m autistic now when it s not in my medical records anymore I ve heard people get tested for things and meet the criteria for the diagnosis but dont want it put on their medical records So technically that would be my case somewhat I m going to save up for a private testing but it could take some time up to a year Diagnosed but self diagnosed,autism

1985,I am rewatching Broadchurch and I made a post in r Broadchurch asking if Alec Hardy is autistic if it's been confirmed by creators and only one person replied with a very kind of nope definitely not go away kind of response I guess being in this subreddit made me forget how much NTs often hate the idea of characters they like being perceived as autistic I love Alex Hardy and I headcanon him as trans and autistic But I love that headcanon particularly because I am trans and autistic so it's not necessarily based on anything I was just surprised by the abruptness of the response Edit here's my post their comment and my response Post Is Alec Autistic I'm rewatching Broadchurch and I'm noticing a lot of things that suggest Alec might be autistic have any of the creators actors spoken about this I'm autistic so it would be nice if it's been confirmed Comment He is with his pickup attempt du wanna relax with me same in US version Gracepoint He may be mildly on the spectrum or he's just a dick Personally I think it's the best show in history but that's got nothing to do with Alec Miller could have been better without them Response personally I'd disagree but given that fictional characters aren't real people I think it's a matter of opinion Autistic Characters,autism

2012,I've been trying to find somebody else for an opinion on this for months and I haven't been able to find anybody The few autistic people I know haven't seen the film There is mention that Vincent could have a neurological condition and ADHD at the start of the film neurological condition 60 probability manic depression 42 probability attention deficit disorder 89 probability heart disorder 99 probability early fatal potential life expectancy 30 2 years He does obsess about space He doesn't let discrimination stop him He hides his identity and gives everything to take on the identity of Jerome Morrow to persue his dream of going to space I'm sure this film is a great metaphor for the lack of potential society sees in us too We're descriminated against and often take on low paid jobs despite having greater ambitions of doing professional jobs in areas like science and engineering to name just a few because very few companies people want to hire autistic people https youtu be E6xqDfrhwaA si m9vWNSsIXE50Z7D4 Is it just me or is the film Gattaca a great metaphor for masking,autism
2013,I've tried multiple pairs all with active noise cancelling and I can still hear everything through them and they don't help with sensory overload So are there any headphones that actually reduce noise significantly What are some good noise cancelling headphones that actually reduce most noise,autism
2014,Do your stims change How about when you have limited space as opposed to having all the space you want What are your stims when you're uncomfortable,autism
2015,If people ever make you feel like there's something wrong with you as if you're weird or socially awkward just remember you aren't the problem they are unless you're an asshole to people for no reason then you should probably grow out of that behavior This advice is coming from someone who has struggled with this thought growing up and still does to an extent due to being constantly infantilized or being treated like a dumb person who doesn't know anything by people Just a reminder,autism
2016,I ll never forget how blown away I was when I found out that neurotypical people pretty much expect you to lie on your resume and that it s common practice to do so I m beginning to think this might be the case for a number of other things as well but I m not entirely sure If possible I d like to compile as much of a list as I can Please comment anything you ve learned that neurotypical people seemingly expect to be lied to about This can range from mundane interactions like how are you to more formal things like job applications things you re supposed to lie about,autism
2017,Listen These horrible things are one of humanity s worst invention They make my hands sweat I want to cry just looking at them the texture is as if those stupid little fibers are squeezing into my pores And then some genius decided to put the same texture on CLOTHES What disgusting neurotypical MONSTER decided to do that And when my hands are dry EWEWEWEWEWEWEW BURN THE TOWEL Repulsive I m personally going to create an Autism Army to destroy those freaks of not-so-nature My hands were sweating while typing this just from thinking about it My war on microfiber towels,autism
